Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors.

Furthermore, embedding constraints on the\nself-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the\nperformance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and\nattention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u9690\u85cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5185\u90e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

We present ASI-Arch,\nthe first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research\n(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully\nautonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to\nconduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring\nhuman-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization\nto automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in\nthe domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel\narchitectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and\nempirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and\npast experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000\nGPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed\nunexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered\narchitectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically\nsurpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for\narchitectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling\nlaw for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural\nbreakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress\nfrom a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide\ncomprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research\ncapabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for\nself-accelerating AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASI-Arch\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eAI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86106\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0cASI-Arch\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edfNAS\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u572820,000 GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u5b8c\u62101,773\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0106\u79cdSOTA\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "ASI-Arch\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a0\u901fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u9650\u5236\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples.

While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack\nwas humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and\n52% for GPTZero.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy.

From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an\nediting framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV\ndatabase equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,\nour gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,\neffectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments\ninvolving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and\nCounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results\ndemonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,\nspecificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance\nacross six representative text understanding and generation tasks.

However, while the\nfirst three elements have been relatively well explored in the literature, the\neffects - and how they may influence positive individual outcomes - have been\nunderexplored thus far. To this end, in this work, we investigate the perceived\noutcomes of eudaimonic gaming and how different components of the experience\ninfluence these effects.

Specifically,\nwe develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder\n(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with\ntailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this\nwork uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability\ntensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic\nproperties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to\ndirect LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a\nsynthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of\nvolume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of\nthe VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and\ninterpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration.

Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts\nacross diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for\nresilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for\ngenerating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically\ngenerated.

To address these issues, we propose the\nMultimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,\nwhich mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment\nas a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality\nvariations.

We evaluate MFTRR on\nthree newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public\nLazada-Home dataset.

For instance,\nwhen 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence\nmetric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\\% of the\noriginal model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by\n4.01%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prune&Comp\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e45\u5ea6\u8865\u507f\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5e45\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPrune&Comp\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u5269\u4f59\u6743\u91cd\u8865\u507f\u5e45\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u526a\u679d5\u5c42LLaMA-3-8B\u65f6\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u4fdd\u755993.19%\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf4.01%\u3002", "conclusion": "Prune&Comp\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The defining\ncharacteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ncapabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\". We advance this concept\nby proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks\nto one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's\nreasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning\nmethodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals\nthe desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These\nresponses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject\na controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning\nprocess. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and\nestablishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive\nempirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably\ntrigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning\nprocess, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

The effectiveness of\nICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which\nfocused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive\nperformances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality\nexamples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)\nDifficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and\nfeedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR\ndecouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval\nmodule to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task\ndataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise\nand guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve\nhigh-quality examples.

Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound.

Surprisingly, we find\nthat we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most\npromising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically\nevaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the\nschool-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and\nAIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens\nachieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting.

A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model\nhas good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the\nparsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces\nuser burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting\nmodel compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the\none-step-ahead prediction accuracy.

When\ncoupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a \"good\"\nprompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us\nto train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for\nthe problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6GSMHard\u548cMATH\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002TRPrompt\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "TRPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u5bf9\u201c\u597d\u201d\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSMHard\u548cMATH\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTRPrompt\u751f\u6210\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TRPrompt\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first\napplies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based\nconceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear\nregression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that\nensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%\nof basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower\nuncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).\nThese results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not\nnecessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is\nassembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction.

The metric $\\mathbf{M}$\nrescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or\nchanges in the frame of reference. The noise $\\mathbf{\\xi}$ enables\nexploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,\nNewton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,\nAdam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same\nunderlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,\nKullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in\nlearning dynamics.

Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the\nincreased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained\ndynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a\nwide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and\nconstraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent\nactions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two\ntasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities\nto adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address\nthe challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS\n(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of\nagents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show\nthat BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI\ncollaboration.
