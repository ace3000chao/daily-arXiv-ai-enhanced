### [1] [Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795)
*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对话转录后处理中添加说话者特征元数据标签的方法，结合冻结的音频基础模型和语言模型，无需微调即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在对话转录后处理中补充元数据标签（如年龄、性别、情感）的方法，以丰富转录内容。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量级连接器桥接音频与语言表示。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，且冻结的LLAMA模型在某些场景下直接比较x-向量时达到8.8%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法无需任务特定微调，保持了模块化和高效性，为对话转录后处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

### [2] [Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796)
*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决传统BPE算法对低资源语言的不公平问题，通过平衡各语言的压缩率，实现更公平的分词结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE算法在分词时倾向于高资源语言，导致低资源语言的分词结果更长、形态不合理甚至包含未知标记，加剧了语言间的计算和资源不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先提升当前压缩率最差的语言的压缩增益，牺牲少量全局压缩率以实现跨语言的公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该算法显著改善了各语言间的分词长度公平性，对全局压缩率和下游任务的语言模型性能影响极小。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的解决方案，能够在不显著牺牲性能的前提下，提升低资源语言的分词公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

### [3] [Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04814)
*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 联合ASR和音高重音检测模型提升ASR性能，音高重音检测F1分数提升41%，ASR的WER降低28.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过音高重音检测模块提升半监督语音表示ASR系统的性能。

Method: 提出联合ASR和音高重音检测的模型，在有限资源下进行微调。

Result: 音高重音检测F1分数显著提升41%，ASR的WER降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 扩展预训练语音模型以保留或重新学习音高重音等韵律线索的重要性。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

*Tommaso Tosato,Saskia Helbling,Yorguin-Jose Mantilla-Ramos,Mahmood Hegazy,Alberto Tosato,David John Lemay,Irina Rish,Guillaume Dumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERSIST框架评估了25+开源大语言模型的人格稳定性，发现即使400B+参数的模型也存在显著响应变异性，提示当前LLM缺乏行为一致性的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型的人格稳定性对安全部署至关重要，但目前对其人格特质的研究不足。

Method: 使用传统和LLM适应的人格测评工具，系统测试模型在不同条件下的响应变异性。

Result: 发现模型响应变异性高，提示干预措施可能增加不稳定性，人格对齐策略可能不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏行为一致性基础，人格对齐策略在安全关键应用中可能不适用。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

### [5] [RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04903)
*Jun Liu,Zhenglun Kong,Changdi Yang,Fan Yang,Tianqi Li,Peiyan Dong,Joannah Nanjekye,Hao Tang,Geng Yuan,Wei Niu,Wenbin Zhang,Pu Zhao,Xue Lin,Dong Huang,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCR-Router是一个动态、角色感知的多代理LLM协作框架，显著减少令牌使用并保持答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协调策略存在令牌消耗高、内存冗余和适应性差的问题，需要更高效的协作方法。

Method: 提出RCR-Router框架，动态选择语义相关内存子集，结合轻量评分策略和共享内存迭代优化。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试中，令牌使用减少30%，答案质量保持或提升。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对可扩展多代理LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

### [6] [I Think, Therefore I Am Under-Qualified? A Benchmark for Evaluating Linguistic Shibboleth Detection in LLM Hiring Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04939)
*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）对语言标志（如性别、社会阶层或地域背景）反应的基准，揭示了模型对某些语言模式（如模糊表达）的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在检测和量化AI系统中的语言歧视，特别是在自动评估系统中对语言模式的偏见。

Method: 通过100个验证过的问题-回答对构建模拟面试，生成受控的语言变体以隔离特定现象，同时保持语义等价。

Result: 模糊表达的回答平均评分低25.6%，验证了基准在识别模型特定偏见方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为检测和测量AI系统中的语言歧视提供了基础框架，对自动决策的公平性具有广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [7] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，用于更全面地评估视觉活动识别系统，解决了动词语义和图像解释的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动词语义和图像解释的模糊性，标准精确匹配评估无法全面评估模型性能。

Method: 提出了一个视觉语言聚类框架，构建动词意义聚类，用于更稳健的评估。

Result: 在imSitu数据集上，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义聚类，聚类评估与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 聚类评估方法提供了更细致的模型性能评估，优于标准评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

### [8] [A Multi-Stage Large Language Model Framework for Extracting Suicide-Related Social Determinants of Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05003)
*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多阶段大型语言模型框架，用于从非结构化文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），以改善自杀事件的早期干预和预防。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对自杀事件的影响需要数据驱动的方法，但现有方法面临长尾分布、关键压力源分析和模型可解释性不足等挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段大型语言模型框架，并与BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1等模型进行比较，同时评估模型解释对标注效率和准确性的影响。

Result: 提出的框架在SDoH因素提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现更优，且通过微调小模型实现了性能相当但推理成本更低的效果。多阶段设计还提升了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期识别高风险个体并制定更有效的预防策略。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [9] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构熵最小化算法的对话分割方法，用于提取目标-方面-观点-情感四元组，显著降低了计算成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设情感元素均匀分布，但实际对话中存在多个语义独立的子对话，跨对话学习会引入噪声。

Method: 利用结构熵最小化算法分割对话为语义独立的子对话，并采用两步框架（先提取情感元素，后匹配四元组）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最优性能，且计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 通过分割对话和两步提取框架，有效解决了噪声问题并提升了四元组提取的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了四种LLM架构（Phi 3.5、Gemma 2、LLaMA 3.2和DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled）在AMR解析任务中的表现，发现简单微调即可达到与复杂SOTA解析器相当的性能，其中LLaMA 3.2表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索仅解码器LLM在AMR解析任务中的潜力，验证简单微调是否能达到复杂SOTA解析器的性能。

Method: 对四种LLM架构进行微调，并使用LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0测试集进行综合评估。

Result: LLaMA 3.2在语义性能上表现最佳（SMATCH F1: 0.804），Phi 3.5在结构有效性上表现突出。

Conclusion: 简单微调仅解码器LLM可在AMR解析任务中达到与复杂SOTA解析器相当的性能，LLaMA 3.2和Phi 3.5各有优势。

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

### [11] [Align, Don't Divide: Revisiting the LoRA Architecture in Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05078)
*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简化LoRA架构的方法，通过高相似性的多头结构或单适配器高秩设计，挑战了多组件范式，并验证了共享表征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多任务学习中，LoRA变体通常采用多适配器或多头结构以捕获任务特定知识，但作者发现这种复杂设计并非必要。

Method: 提出简化多头架构和单适配器高秩设计，并进一步提出Align-LoRA，通过显式损失对齐任务表征。

Result: 实验表明，简化设计和Align-LoRA均显著优于基线，验证了共享表征的重要性。

Conclusion: 多任务学习的泛化能力依赖于学习鲁棒的共享表征，而非隔离任务特定特征，Align-LoRA为此提供了更简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为MultiCheck的统一框架，用于细粒度多模态事实验证，通过结合文本和图像编码器及跨模态关系融合模块，显著提升了事实核查性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态错误信息（结合文本和图像的虚假信息）的增长对主要依赖文本证据的事实核查系统提出了挑战。

Method: 提出MultiCheck框架，结合专用文本和图像编码器，通过跨模态元素交互融合模块和对比学习目标，预测声明的真实性。

Result: 在Factify 2数据集上实现了0.84的加权F1分数，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 多模态显式推理的有效性证明了该方法在复杂现实场景中可扩展和可解释的事实核查潜力。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [13] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BEE-RAG的框架，通过熵不变性原理改进RAG系统对不同上下文长度的适应性，解决了长检索上下文导致的熵增长和注意力稀释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识局限性促使检索增强生成（RAG）成为重要方法，但长检索上下文会导致熵增长和注意力稀释，影响性能。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，利用平衡上下文熵重新定义注意力动态，分离注意力敏感性与上下文长度，并通过零样本推理和参数高效微调机制优化平衡因子。

Result: 在多个RAG任务上的实验证明了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵工程优化了RAG系统的性能，解决了长上下文带来的问题。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）对输入信息位置敏感的现象，提出了一种名为AttnRank的无训练、即插即用方法，通过重新排序输入内容以优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs对输入信息位置敏感的原因，并提出解决方案以提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank)，通过校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重新排序输入内容。

Result: 在多项任务中，AttnRank显著提升了10种不同架构和规模的LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效、无需训练的方法，能够显著优化LLMs的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Motivation: 当前基准测试常忽略对大型语言模型伦理推理的评估，医疗领域的伦理问题尤为重要。

Method: 基于Principlism理论，构建了一个包含选择题和开放式问题的高质量数据集，并由医学专家验证。

Result: 实验显示模型在伦理知识的实际应用上存在不足，尤其是动态应用伦理原则时。前沿闭源模型表现最佳，但医疗领域微调可提升伦理能力。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA为诊断模型伦理弱点提供了可扩展框架，推动更平衡和负责任的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: This paper presents the contributions of the ATLANTIS team to SemEval-2025
Task 3, focusing on detecting hallucinated text spans in question answering
systems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural
Language Generation (NLG) but remain susceptible to hallucinations, generating
incorrect or misleading content. To address this, we explored methods both with
and without external context, utilizing few-shot prompting with a LLM,
token-level classification or LLM fine-tuned on synthetic data. Notably, our
approaches achieved top rankings in Spanish and competitive placements in
English and German. This work highlights the importance of integrating relevant
context to mitigate hallucinations and demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
models and prompt engineering.

Method: 采用“教师-助理-学生”蒸馏范式，先利用高性能MLLM生成初始推理数据集，训练中等规模的助理模型，再联合训练轻量级学生模型进行高效推理和分类。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，仅3B参数的MulCoT-RD在JMSRC任务上表现优异，具有强泛化能力和解释性。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD为资源受限环境下的多模态情感分析提供了高效解决方案，兼具性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

TL;DR: CodeBoost是一个无需人工标注指令的代码LLM后训练框架，通过代码片段提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注的指令，成本高且难以扩展，而代码片段资源丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: CodeBoost包含最大团选择、双向预测、错误感知预测、异构增强和异构奖励五个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost在多模型和基准测试中均能提升性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种可扩展且高效的后训练方法。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）推理链的可靠性问题，尤其是错误在推理链不同阶段的影响。

Method: 提出ASCoT方法，包括自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE），通过位置影响评分函数和双路径校正解决晚期脆弱性问题。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH等基准测试中，ASCoT表现优异，超越标准CoT等基线方法。

Conclusion: 强调诊断LLM推理特定失败模式的重要性，提倡采用自适应、针对脆弱性的校正机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Result: 在39M到1.3B参数范围内，SONAR-LLM实现了竞争性的生成质量。

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM在保留LCM优势的同时简化了训练，并提供了可复现的研究资源。

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理中常因反思行为导致过度思考问题，增加计算成本，降低实用性。

Method: CGRS通过动态抑制高置信度时的反思触发词，避免冗余反思循环，无需重新训练或修改模型架构。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，CGRS平均减少18.5%至41.9%的token使用量，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: CGRS在多种模型架构和规模下均表现出色，为高效推理提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Method: 通过专家德国手语（DGS）用户与可调整和不可调整虚拟形象的交互分析，评估理解度、用户体验和接受度。

Result: 用户偏好可调整设置，但未显著改善用户体验或理解度；压力水平更高；接受度依赖可用性和动画质量。

Conclusion: 个性化不足，需默认理解度；建议改进口型和面部动画、交互界面及参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Motivation: 解决LLMs因训练数据偏向高资源语言（如英语和中文）而导致的文化偏见问题，特别是在低资源语言环境下。

Method: 设计MyCulture基准，涵盖马来西亚文化的六个方面（艺术、服饰、习俗、娱乐、食物、宗教），使用开放式多选题格式，并分析结构和语言偏见。

Conclusion: MyCulture通过开放式结构和多语言评估，为LLMs的公平性和文化包容性提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language

Conclusion: 研究强调需要更稳健、通用的评估框架，以更好地与人类创造力判断对齐。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG)方法，通过问题分解和依赖感知推理增强大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中易产生幻觉，现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中表现不足。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题，按逻辑依赖顺序解决，并引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 实验表明LAG显著提升推理鲁棒性，减少幻觉，并与人类认知更一致。

Conclusion: LAG为现有检索增强生成系统提供了更优的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在主动提问时表现出地理和文化偏见，尤其是在全球南北和东西差异上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在主动提问时隐含的地理和文化偏见，这些偏见在标准提示设置中难以发现。

Method: 通过20 Questions游戏测试LLMs在多种语言和配置下的表现，使用新数据集Geo20Q+。

Result: LLMs在推断全球北方和西方实体时表现更好，且语言对性能差距影响较小。

Conclusion: 自由形式的评估框架能有效揭示LLMs的隐含偏见，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

TL;DR: CoCoLex是一种解码策略，通过动态结合模型生成的词汇分布和从上下文中复制的分布，提高法律文本生成的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在法律领域生成不可靠或虚构内容的问题，提升生成文本的忠实性。

Method: 提出Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding (CoCoLex)，根据模型置信度动态调整从上下文复制的比例。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoCoLex有效提升了法律文本生成的忠实度，尤其在复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于频率的不确定性量化方法，利用共形预测确保覆盖保证，提升LLM在MCQA中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多选题回答中的不可靠性（如幻觉和过度自信），以支持高风险领域的应用。

Method: 通过多次独立采样模型的输出分布，以最高频率样本为参考计算预测熵（PE），并与共形预测结合。

Result: 实验表明，频率PE在区分正确与错误预测上优于基于logit的PE，并能有效控制误覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒场景下的不确定性量化提供了分布无关、模型无关的框架，增强了LLM的实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）在西方语言中政治观点的跨语言差异较小，且政治对齐后观点几乎在所有语言中一致变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言大语言模型是否反映跨语言的政治观点差异，以及政治对齐对模型观点的影响。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs对政治声明表达（不）同意，评估五种西方语言中模型的意见，并在对齐前后进行比较。

Result: 未对齐模型显示极少显著跨语言差异；政治对齐后观点在所有语言中几乎一致变化。

Conclusion: 西方语言背景下，政治观点在语言间转移，突显了实现MLLMs明确社会语言、文化和政治对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith是一个新框架，通过从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成高难度数学问题，提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工模板，缺乏多样性和可扩展性，限制了LLM在数学推理上的进步。

Method: MathSmith从零构建问题，采用九种策略增加难度，并通过强化学习优化结构有效性、推理复杂性和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，MathSmith在短链和长链推理设置下均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了高难度合成数据在提升LLM推理能力方面的潜力，具有强扩展性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出Cooper框架，通过联合优化策略模型和奖励模型，结合规则和模型奖励的优势，解决奖励模型中的鲁棒性和奖励破解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则和基于模型的奖励方法各有不足：规则奖励缺乏鲁棒性，模型奖励易受奖励破解影响。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，动态构建正负样本对训练奖励模型，并引入混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模范式。

Result: 实验显示Cooper缓解了奖励破解，提升了端到端强化学习性能，如在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上平均准确率提升0.54%。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是应对奖励破解的有效方法，为奖励模型与强化学习的更好结合提供了参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在具身推理中的能力，填补现有研究在动态工具获取和自主协调策略方面的空白。

Method: 通过文本环境表示建模连续物理属性和复杂空间关系，覆盖1,500个家庭和工业场景，系统评估模型性能。

Result: 模型在显式指令下表现良好（85-96%成功率），但在工具推理和隐式协作中表现下降（56-85%），复合任务失败率超50%。完整环境信息反而降低协调性能。

Conclusion: 具身推理对当前模型构成根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI系统提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有的推理大语言模型在长形式事实性任务中容易产生幻觉，且在线强化学习中缺乏可靠的验证方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的奖励函数，综合考虑事实准确性、详细程度和相关性，并应用于在线强化学习。

Result: 在六个长形式事实性基准测试中，幻觉率平均降低23.1%，回答详细程度提高23%，且整体回答质量未下降。

Conclusion: 新奖励函数有效提升了推理大语言模型的事实性和回答质量。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Method: 利用认知科学训练线性探针，分析多轮对话中的说服动态，包括说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略。

Result: 探针在样本和数据集层面均能有效捕捉说服动态，且在识别说服策略等任务中表现优于提示方法。

Conclusion: 线性探针是研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操纵）的高效工具，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Result: 在1.4B标记的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++实现了最佳性能：压缩率提升12%，ParsGLUE任务提升5.4pp，ZWNJ鲁棒性提升53%，形态边界F1达73.8%。

Conclusion: H-NET++的分层动态分块为MRLs提供了一种无需显式监督的有效无分词器解决方案，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探讨AI搜索应用中冗长复杂回答对用户满意度的影响，挑战“更复杂的回答等于更好性能”的假设。

Method: 通过比较10,000名参与者对五大AI搜索系统的反应，分析用户偏好。

Result: 用户明显偏好简洁且有来源标注的回答，冗长回答导致认知负担和信任下降。

Conclusion: AI应模仿人类有效沟通方式：简洁、透明并标注来源，以提升用户满意度和系统可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in search applications increasingly prioritize
verbose, lexically complex responses that paradoxically reduce user
satisfaction and engagement. Through a comprehensive study of 10.000 (est.)
participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems, we
demonstrate that users overwhelmingly prefer concise, source-attributed
responses over elaborate explanations. Our analysis reveals that current AI
development trends toward "artificial sophistication" create an uncanny valley
effect where systems sound knowledgeable but lack genuine critical thinking,
leading to reduced trust and increased cognitive load. We present evidence that
optimal AI communication mirrors effective human discourse: direct, properly
sourced, and honest about limitations. Our findings challenge the prevailing
assumption that more complex AI responses indicate better performance, instead
suggesting that human-like brevity and transparency are key to user engagement
and system reliability.

Motivation: 解决3D用户界面中远距离对象直接手势操作缺乏的问题，提供更自然的交互体验。

Result: 用户研究表明，SightWarp比传统间接技术（如凝视和捏合）性能更优。

Conclusion: SightWarp为远近空间对象交互提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In 3D user interfaces, reaching out to grab and manipulate something works
great until it is out of reach. Indirect techniques like gaze and pinch offer
an alternative for distant interaction, but do not provide the same immediacy
or proprioceptive feedback as direct gestures. To support direct gestures for
faraway objects, we introduce SightWarp, an interaction technique that exploits
eye-hand coordination to seamlessly summon object proxies to the user's
fingertips. The idea is that after looking at a distant object, users either
shift their gaze to the hand or move their hand into view-triggering the
creation of a scaled near-space proxy of the object and its surrounding
context. The proxy remains active until the eye-hand pattern is released. The
key benefit is that users always have an option to immediately operate on the
distant object through a natural, direct hand gesture. Through a user study of
a 3D object docking task, we show that users can easily employ SightWarp, and
that subsequent direct manipulation improves performance over gaze and pinch.
Application examples illustrate its utility for 6DOF manipulation,
overview-and-detail navigation, and world-in-miniature interaction. Our work
contributes to expressive and flexible object interactions across near and far
spaces.

Models (LLMs) and introduces a novel prompting technique called
Charts-of-Thought. We tested three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.7-sonnet,
GPT-4.5 preview, and Gemini-2.0-pro) on the Visualization Literacy Assessment
Test (VLAT) using standard prompts and our structured approach. The
Charts-of-Thought method guides LLMs through a systematic data extraction,
verification, and analysis process before answering visualization questions.
Our results show Claude-3.7-sonnet achieved a score of 50.17 using this method,
far exceeding the human baseline of 28.82. This approach improved performance
across all models, with score increases of 21.8% for GPT-4.5, 9.4% for
Gemini-2.0, and 13.5% for Claude-3.7 compared to standard prompting. The
performance gains were consistent across original and modified VLAT charts,
with Claude correctly answering 100% of questions for several chart types that
previously challenged LLMs. Our study reveals that modern multimodal LLMs can
surpass human performance on visualization literacy tasks when given the proper
analytical framework. These findings establish a new benchmark for LLM
visualization literacy and demonstrate the importance of structured prompting
strategies for complex visual interpretation tasks. Beyond improving LLM
visualization literacy, Charts-of-Thought could also enhance the accessibility
of visualizations, potentially benefiting individuals with visual impairments
or lower visualization literacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示GRASP系统的扩展实现，同时为Scheme社区提供相关问题的解决方案参考。

Method: 描述GRASP及其扩展机制的设计与架构，尽管系统尚未完成，但问题解决方案具有参考价值。

Result: 提出了GRASP系统的扩展实现方法，并探讨了其设计问题。

Conclusion: GRASP的设计和扩展机制问题对Scheme社区具有潜在价值，尽管系统仍在开发中。

Abstract: The direct purpose of this paper - as its title suggests - is to present how
the visual evaluator extension is implemented in the GRASP programming system.
The indirect purpose is to provide a tutorial around the design of GRASP, and
in particular - around the architecture of its extension mechanism. Neither
GRASP nor its extension mechanisms are, at the moment of writing this paper,
final or complete, and we are certain that some details of the solutions
described in here will change even before the first release. What will not
change, though, is the set of problems that need to be solved in order to build
a system with capabilities similar to those of GRASP. We believe that these
problems might be of interest to the Scheme community.

TL;DR: 研究探讨高中生如何通过算法审计识别和理解日常AI/ML工具中的偏见，并展示了他们在审计中的创造性和独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI/ML技术日益融入青少年生活，亟需培养他们的AI素养，包括技术知识和社会影响意识。

Method: 通过为期两周的参与式设计工作坊，14名青少年审计了TikTok的Effect House生成AI模型。

Result: 青少年在审计中表现出高度的参与度和创造力，发现了专业审计中不常见的年龄偏见等问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明，算法审计可作为培养AI素养的学习活动，赋予青少年批判性审视AI系统的能力，并为算法危害研究提供新视角。

Abstract: This study investigates how high school-aged youth engage in algorithm
auditing to identify and understand biases in artificial intelligence and
machine learning (AI/ML) tools they encounter daily. With AI/ML technologies
being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent
need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge
and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have
traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but
recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate
productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop
with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model
behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters.
We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from
deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and
communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged
and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new
considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional
audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their
findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach
coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes
in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly
different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the
potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies,
empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh
perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a critical tool for investigating adverse events
in healthcare and improving patient safety. However, existing RCA training
programs are often limited by high resource demands, leading to insufficient
training and inconsistent implementation. To address this challenge, we present
an AI-powered 3D simulation game that helps healthcare professionals develop
RCA skills through interactive, immersive simulations. This approach offers a
cost-effective, scalable, and accessible alternative to traditional training.
The prototype simulates an RCA investigation following a death in the ICU,
where learners interview five virtual avatars representing ICU team members to
investigate the incident and complete a written report. The system enables
natural, life-like interactions with avatars via large language models (LLMs),
emotional text-to-speech, and AI-powered animations. An additional LLM
component provides formative and summative feedback to support continual
improvement. We conclude by outlining plans to empirically evaluate the
system's efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）暴露了当代知识基础设施的脆弱性，因为它们模拟连贯性但绕过了传统的引用、权威和验证模式。

Method: 结合基础设施研究、平台理论和认识论，SEI框架通过追踪可信度在制度、计算和时间安排中的中介作用，强调协调而非分类。

Result: SEI框架为AI治理、知识生产和信息系统伦理设计提供了替代传统表征主义模型的方案。

Conclusion: SEI框架为后连贯性条件下的知识权威性分析提供了新视角，强调适应性认知管理的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the
fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence
while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This
paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a
diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid
human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on
stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how
credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal
arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform
theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over
classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of
epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance,
knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering
a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来学习成果和学生参与度的实证评估奠定了基础，并可作为更广泛机构采用的模板。

Abstract: Computer science education has evolved extensively; however, systemic
barriers still prevent students with visual impairments from fully
participating. While existing research has developed specialized programming
tools and assistive technologies, these solutions remain fragmented and often
require complex technical infrastructure, which limits their classroom
implementation. Current approaches treat accessibility as individual
accommodations rather than integral curriculum design, creating gaps in
holistic educational support. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for
redesigning introductory computer science curricula to provide equitable
learning experiences for students with visual impairments without requiring
specialized technical infrastructure. The framework outlines five key
components that together contribute a systematic approach to curriculum
accessibility: accessible learning resources with pre-distributed materials and
tactile diagrams, in-class learning kits with hands-on demonstrations,
structured support systems with dedicated teaching assistance, an online tool
repository, and psychosocial support for classroom participation. Unlike
existing tool-focused solutions, this framework addresses both technical and
pedagogical dimensions of inclusive education while emphasizing practical
implementation in standard university settings. The design is grounded in
universal design principles and validated through expert consultation with
accessibility specialists and disability services professionals, establishing
foundations for future empirical evaluation of learning outcomes and student
engagement while serving as a template for broader institutional adoption.

Abstract: Mixed reality (MR) environments are bound to become ubiquitous as MR
technology becomes lighter, higher resolution, more affordable, and overall
becomes a seamless extension of our current work and living spaces. For
research scientists and clinicians focused on understanding 3D phenomena or
patient pathologies within the context of the larger human anatomy, that means
a necessary evolution of their workstations currently only utilizing 2D
interfaces for everyday communication, logistics and data analysis. MR
technologies bring forth immersive 3D representations coexisting in our natural
spaces, while allowing for richer interconnected information displays, where 3D
representations greatly aid in the detailed understanding of physical
structures, spatial relationships, and 3D contextualization of 2D measurements,
projections, abstractions, and other data details. We present a breakdown of
the different interaction zones and modalities into a design space that best
accommodates the creation of applications for users engaged through MR

Result: 电极数量减少53.5%，SparseEMG工具支持50+手势，验证了布局的跨用户可转移性。

Conclusion: SparseEMG工具能高效生成稀疏电极布局，保持准确性，适用于多种硬件设置。

Abstract: Gesture recognition with electromyography (EMG) is a complex problem
influenced by gesture sets, electrode count and placement, and machine learning
parameters (e.g., features, classifiers). Most existing toolkits focus on
streamlining model development but overlook the impact of electrode selection
on classification accuracy. In this work, we present the first data-driven
analysis of how electrode selection and classifier choice affect both accuracy
and sparsity. Through a systematic evaluation of 28 combinations (4 selection
schemes, 7 classifiers), across six datasets, we identify an approach that
minimizes electrode count without compromising accuracy. The results show that
Permutation Importance (selection scheme) with Random Forest (classifier)
reduces the number of electrodes by 53.5\%. Based on these findings, we
introduce SparseEMG, a design tool that generates sparse electrode layouts
based on user-selected gesture sets, electrode constraints, and ML parameters
while also predicting classification performance. SparseEMG supports 50+ unique
gestures and is validated in three real-world applications using different
hardware setups. Results from our multi-dataset evaluation show that the
layouts generated from the SparseEMG design tool are transferable across users
with only minimal variation in gesture recognition performance.

Conclusion: 元认知在CPS中起到关键作用，通过调节探索与利用知识的过程，促进问题解决和知识涌现。

Abstract: Metacognition is an important aspect in creative problem solving (CPS) and
through this chapter we analyse the meta-reasoning aspects applied in the
different processes of monitoring the progress of learners' reasoning and CPS
activities. Meta-reasoning monitors the way that problem-solving processes
advance and regulate time and efforts towards a solution. In the context of an
ill-defined problem, exploration is required to develop a better-defined
problem space and advance towards the solution space. The way learners engage
in exploration and exploitations is regulated by the meta-reasoning within the
CPS activity. The objective of this chapter is to examine and identify the CPS
process with educational robots through a metacognitive and interactionist
approach. This chapter presents a case study, where, to solve a problem, a
participant had to explore a set of robot cubes to develop the technological
knowledge associated with each single component of the system, but also
conceptualize a system-level behaviour of the cubes when they are assembled.
The chapter presents the emergence of knowledge through the metacognitive
regulation of the process of exploration and exploitation of prior knowledge
and emergent knowledge until finding a solution

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通道级EEG特征选择方法（CWEFS），通过整合共享潜在结构模型和自适应通道权重学习，显著提高了多维情感识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维多通道EEG特征中存在大量冗余信息，影响情感表征提取和实时性能，现有方法忽略了潜在EEG特征结构对情感标签相关性的影响。

Method: CWEFS结合共享潜在结构模型和自适应通道权重学习，构建跨通道的共识潜在空间，并保留局部几何结构。

Result: 在三个流行EEG数据集上验证，CWEFS选择的特征子集在六个评估指标上表现最优。

Conclusion: CWEFS有效解决了EEG特征选择中的冗余问题，提升了情感识别的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Due to the intracranial volume conduction effects, high-dimensional
multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features often contain substantial
redundant and irrelevant information. This issue not only hinders the
extraction of discriminative emotional representations but also compromises the
real-time performance. Feature selection has been established as an effective
approach to address the challenges while enhancing the transparency and
interpretability of emotion recognition models. However, existing EEG feature
selection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on
emotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various
channels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection
models for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations,
a novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume
conduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a
shared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space
across diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this
consensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive
channel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of
different EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The
effectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results,
compared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG
feature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance
across six evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于EEG的多维情绪识别新算法，通过自适应双自表达学习（ADSEL）和最小二乘回归解决标签不完整问题，提高特征选择效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG特征高维性和样本量有限导致分类器过拟合和计算复杂度高，现有方法假设标签完整，而实际中标签常不完整，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 结合自适应双自表达学习（ADSEL）与最小二乘回归，通过样本级和维度级自表达学习的双向信息共享，优化标签重建和特征选择。

Result: ADSEL提高了标签恢复精度，并有效识别出最优EEG特征子集，提升多维情绪识别性能。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了标签不完整问题，显著提升了EEG多维情绪识别的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: EEG based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial
research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high
dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently
leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature
selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most
existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional
emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent
subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which
can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection
methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on
correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the
correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with
various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion
recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression
learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a
bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression
learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the
cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the
simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and
dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label
recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FDC-Net的新型框架，通过深度耦合去噪和情感识别任务，实现了端到端的噪声鲁棒情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号易受生理伪迹干扰，现有方法将去噪和情感识别视为独立任务，导致误差累积且未能利用任务间的协同效应。

Method: FDC-Net通过双向梯度传播和联合优化策略，以及门控注意力机制与频率自适应Transformer的结合，建立了动态协作机制。

Result: 在DEAP和DREAMER数据集上，FDC-Net在去噪任务中分别达到96.30%和90.31%的CC值，情感识别任务中分别达到82.3%和88.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: FDC-Net通过动态协作机制显著提升了噪声鲁棒性和情感识别性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value
in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical
applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various
physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and
emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which
not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential
synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion
recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly
denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address
these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion
recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition,
termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification
Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic
collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition
through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization
strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive
Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based
emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels
were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition
performance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the
denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of
96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the
emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net
achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on
DREAMER.

Abstract: Level 3 automated driving systems allows drivers to engage in secondary tasks
while diminishing their perception of risk. In the event of an emergency
necessitating driver intervention, the system will alert the driver with a
limited window for reaction and imposing a substantial cognitive burden. To
address this challenge, this study employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
assist drivers in maintaining an appropriate attention on road conditions
through a "humanized" persuasive advice. Our tool leverages the road conditions
encountered by Level 3 systems as triggers, proactively steering driver
behavior via both visual and auditory routes. Empirical study indicates that
our tool is effective in sustaining driver attention with reduced cognitive
load and coordinating secondary tasks with takeover behavior. Our work provides
insights into the potential of using LLMs to support drivers during multi-task
automated driving.

among users in Bangladesh through a comprehensive mixed-methods approach. By
integrating quantitative survey data with qualitative interview insights, we
examine how cultural, social, and contextual factors influence users'
understanding of fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems. Our
findings reveal nuanced attitudes toward human oversight, explanation
mechanisms, and contestability, highlighting the importance of culturally aware
design principles for equitable and trustworthy algorithmic systems. These
insights contribute to ongoing discussions on algorithmic fairness by
foregrounding perspectives from a non-Western context, thus broadening the
global dialogue on ethical AI deployment.

*Jonathan C. Roberts,Hanan Alnjar,Aron E. Owen,Panagiotis D. Ritsos*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Critical Design Strategy (CDS)的结构化方法，通过反思和批判性思维帮助设计师评估和改进可视化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化设计领域，尤其是新手设计师，常面临识别改进点的挑战，需要一种系统的方法来促进批判性思维。

Method: CDS分为三个阶段：1）初步印象形成（标题和形容词选择）；2）深入批判（30个启发式问题，覆盖六个关键视角）；3）综合反思和下一步规划。

Result: CDS在本科和研究生课程中得到应用，并通过多年实践不断优化，包括问题表述改进和支持材料的扩充。

Conclusion: CDS是一种实用且可扩展的工具，适用于可视化设计教学和实践，未来可进一步推广。

Abstract: We present the Critical Design Strategy (CDS) - a structured method designed
to facilitate the examination of visualisation designs through reflection and
critical thought. The CDS helps designers think critically and make informed
improvements using heuristic evaluation. When developing a visual tool or
pioneering a novel visualisation approach, identifying areas for enhancement
can be challenging. Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation
designers and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as
studying visualisation in higher education. The CDS consists of three stages
across six perspectives: Stage 1 captures the essence of the idea by assigning
an indicative title and selecting five adjectives (from twenty options) to form
initial impressions of the design. Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using
30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives - user, environment,
interface, components, design, and visual marks. Stage 3 focuses on
synthesising insights, reflecting on design decisions, and determining the next
steps forward. We introduce the CDS and explore its use across three
visualisation modules in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Our
longstanding experience with the CDS has allowed us to refine and develop it
over time: from its initial creation through workshops in 2017/18 to
improvements in wording and the development of two applications by 2020,
followed by the expansion of support notes and refinement of heuristics through
2023; while using it in our teaching each year. This sustained use allows us to
reflect on its practical application and offer guidance on how others can
incorporate it into their own work.

Abstract: Traditionally, specialized 3D design data, such as BIM and CAD, have been
accessible only to a select group of experts, creating significant barriers
that prevent general users from participating in decision-making processes.
This paper provides a systematic overview of practical insights for utilizing
3D data in industrial and architectural domains by presenting implementation
cases of the industrial metaverse on Cluster, a commercial cross-device
metaverse platform. This paper analyzes the characteristics and constraints of
major data formats in the industrial and architectural fields and organizes
integration workflows for the metaverse. Through application cases utilizing 3D
data across multiple domains, we present practical examples of collaborative
decision-making support enabled by the fusion of metaverse and digital twin
technologies. Specifically, we demonstrate that multi-device access and
simultaneous multi-user participation capabilities foster democratic
environments in the industrial metaverse, which are challenging to achieve with
conventional, expert-dependent systems.

### [64] [Towards Human-Centric Evaluation of Interaction-Aware Automated Vehicle Controllers: A Framework and Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05497)
*Federico Scarì,Olger Siebinga,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构化评估框架，用于评估自动驾驶车辆（AV）与人类驾驶车辆（HDV）的交互，弥补了现有研究忽视人类中心维度的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注AV控制算法的技术性能，而忽略了与HDV交互的人类中心维度，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出一个包含四个关键领域（交互效果、交互感知、交互努力和交互能力）的评估框架，并通过驾驶模拟器中的合并场景案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: 研究表明，涵盖所有四个领域的评估指标可以揭示AV与HDV交互中的关键差异，强调了更全面评估的必要性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究者、开发者和政策制定者提供了系统评估AV行为的方法，促进开发不仅功能强大且对人类友好、安全和可接受的AV。

Abstract: As automated vehicles (AVs) increasingly integrate into mixed-traffic
environments, evaluating their interaction with human-driven vehicles (HDVs)
becomes critical. In most research focused on developing new AV control
algorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed
solely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping
efficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of
interaction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework
that addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot
interaction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction
effect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction
ability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on
human drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply
it to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts
with human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring
HDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative
metric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how
participants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,
aggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.
The results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the
evaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver
experience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more
comprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,
developers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour
beyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not
only functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a
human perspective.

Method: 使用AE-GAN提取先验知识，提出LMCF框架通过多视角对比学习自适应学习特征。

Result: 在三个目标数据集上优于七种基线方法，适用于心肌梗塞、阿尔茨海默病和帕金森病诊断。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升医疗诊断效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: In medical time series disease diagnosis, two key challenges are identified.
First, the high annotation cost of medical data leads to overfitting in models
trained on label-limited, single-center datasets. To address this, we propose
incorporating external data from related tasks and leveraging AE-GAN to extract
prior knowledge, providing valuable references for downstream tasks. Second,
many existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized
medical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on
manually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs. However, these
approaches are complex, lack generalizability, and fail to adaptively capture
disease-specific features across different conditions. To overcome this, we
introduce LMCF (Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework), a framework that
integrates a multi-head attention mechanism and adaptively learns
representations from different views through inter-view and intra-view
contrastive learning strategies. Additionally, the pre-trained AE-GAN is used
to reconstruct discrepancies in the target data as disease probabilities, which
are then integrated into the contrastive learning process. Experiments on three
target datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other
seven baselines, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare applications
such as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and
Parkinson's disease. We release the source code at xxxxx.

TL;DR: NAEx是一个模型无关的框架，用于解释网络对齐模型的决策，通过识别关键子图和特征来提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络对齐模型的可解释性不足，限制了在高风险领域的信任和应用。

Method: NAEx通过可学习的边和特征掩码联合参数化图结构和特征空间，并引入优化目标确保解释忠实于原始预测。

Result: NAEx在基准数据集上表现出高效性和有效性，支持四种代表性网络对齐模型。

Conclusion: NAEx为网络对齐模型提供了可解释性，解决了跨网络依赖和特征相似性比较的挑战。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型在复杂指令、细粒度内容控制和语义一致性方面存在不足，LVLM的跨模态理解能力为解决这些问题提供了潜力。

Method: LumiGen包含IPPA模块（智能提示解析与增强）和IVFR模块（迭代视觉反馈与优化），通过闭环反馈机制提升图像生成质量。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I基准测试中，LumiGen以3.08的平均分优于现有方法，尤其在文本渲染和姿态表达方面表现突出。

Conclusion: LVLM的集成显著提升了T2I模型的可控性和生成质量，验证了LumiGen框架的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在边缘设备上计算资源需求高，云端解决方案存在隐私风险、个性化效率低和通信成本高的问题。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）进行本地微调，基于任务需求相似性聚类客户端，进行集群内聚合和集群间知识交互。

Result: 框架在边缘约束下加速收敛，支持可扩展的多用户个性化AIGC服务。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护、个性化和效率方面表现优异，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小样本学习在数据稀缺的科学领域（如生物医学、环境科学等）中至关重要，但传统方法泛化能力有限。

Method: 构建了多模态数据集M3FD，并开发了M3F框架，通过多模态模型的预训练和微调提升FSL性能。

Result: M3F框架在相同类型的任务上优于传统元学习方法，为数据稀缺领域的FSL提供了可行解决方案。

Conclusion: M3FD和M3F为数据稀缺的科学领域提供了统一且可扩展的FSL解决方案，降低了应用门槛。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol是一种基于属性引导的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在分子属性预测任务中的表现，通过结构化输出和验证机制显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在分子属性预测中依赖人工设计的提示和思维链模板，推理过程冗长且缺乏相关性。

Method: AttriLens-Mol通过三种奖励机制（格式奖励、计数奖励和合理性奖励）引导模型生成结构化输出，并验证属性的相关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在7B规模的模型上显著提升了性能，优于监督微调模型和先进模型（如GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol能更有效地提取相关分子属性，提升预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态时间序列数据（尤其是文本模态）常受干扰，现有方法常忽略文本数据的固有扰动，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PA-RNet框架，包含扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，理论证明其Lipschitz连续性和预测误差降低能力。

Result: 实验表明PA-RNet在多种领域和时间设置下均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet通过扰动感知和跨模态交互，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

TL;DR: InfoQ是一种新颖的混合精度量化框架，通过单次前向传播测量层间互信息变化来评估量化敏感性，无需训练即可高效分配比特宽度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算昂贵的搜索算法或局部敏感性代理（如Hessian），无法捕捉量化误差的全局影响。

Method: InfoQ通过量化每层不同比特宽度并测量后续层互信息变化，将比特分配问题转化为整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在MobileNetV2和ResNet18上，InfoQ在高压缩率下（14X和10.66X）实现了1%的精度提升，且搜索效率更高。

Conclusion: InfoQ提供了一种高效、无需训练的比特分配方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态治疗决策（DTRs）中的潜力，解决临床知识注入和患者安全的工程难题。

Method: 在1型糖尿病模拟器中，比较开源LLMs与训练过的SRAs的零样本推理性能。

Result: LLMs在稳定患者群体中表现优异，但存在剂量过激、算术幻觉等问题。

Conclusion: 建议结合提示工程、验证和混合方法，安全整合LLMs到临床决策中。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

Conclusion: EPOPR在效率和公平性上优于现有方法，为电力恢复提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合联邦学习和持续学习的新任务FCRec，并提出了F3CRec框架，通过自适应重放记忆和项目级时间均值来平衡知识保留与适应，提升了推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐方法难以处理非静态数据流，而持续学习方法又依赖集中式数据访问，无法满足隐私保护需求。

Method: 提出F3CRec框架，包含客户端自适应重放记忆和服务器端项目级时间均值两个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明F3CRec在联邦环境中长期保持推荐质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F3CRec成功解决了联邦持续推荐任务中的隐私保护与动态适应问题。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

*Lin Jiang,Yu Yang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以人为中心的网约车系统HCRide，通过多智能体强化学习算法Habic，平衡系统效率、乘客公平性和司机偏好。实验表明，HCRide在效率和公平性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车系统多关注效率，忽视乘客公平性和司机偏好，导致体验不佳。本文旨在设计一个兼顾三者的系统。

Method: 提出HCRide系统，采用Habic算法（包含多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络）优化效率、公平性和司机偏好。

Result: 在深圳和纽约的真实数据集上，HCRide将系统效率提升2.02%，公平性提升5.39%，司机偏好提升10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide成功平衡了系统效率、乘客公平性和司机偏好，为网约车系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经时间点过程模型通常是自回归的，限制了效率和长范围预测的准确性。

Method: 通过连续和离散流匹配，联合建模事件间隔时间和事件类型。

Result: 在六个真实世界基准测试中，模型在准确性和生成效率上显著优于自回归和基于扩散的基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为非自回归建模标记事件序列提供了有效解决方案，适用于长范围预测。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对车载CAN网络的多阶段入侵检测框架，结合无监督异常检测和监督图学习，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAN协议缺乏内置安全性，易受网络攻击，因此需要一种高效的入侵检测方法。

Method: 采用变分图自编码器（VGAE）进行结构异常检测，结合知识蒸馏图注意力网络（KD-GAT）进行分类，并通过选择性欠采样解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在六个公开CAN数据集上测试，平均F1分数提升16.2%，参数减少96%。

Conclusion: 该框架在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，尤其适用于高度不平衡的数据集。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OPTQ（GPTQ）因其计算效率和强经验性能被广泛采用，但缺乏严格的理论保证。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析OPTQ的迭代过程如何引入量化误差，推导了非渐近2-范数误差界限，并扩展到Qronos算法。

Result: 提供了OPTQ和Qronos的确定性及随机变体的误差界限，解释了其设计选择的合理性。

Conclusion: 本文的理论分析为OPTQ和Qronos的实际应用提供了指导，并解释了其优势。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

TL;DR: Agnostics是一种语言无关的后训练管道，通过观察代码的外部行为来验证多语言代码，无需为每种语言单独设计测试框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源编程语言在LLMs中表现不佳的问题，避免为每种语言单独设计数据集和测试基础设施的繁琐工作。

Method: 1. 将现有单元测试数据集转换为I/O格式；2. 提供简短的配置指导验证器如何编译和运行目标语言；3. 在稳健的代码执行环境中应用RLVR（可验证奖励的强化学习）。

Result: 在五种低资源语言（Lua、Julia、R、OCaml、Fortran）上，Agnostics显著提升了模型性能，甚至媲美更大规模的模型，并在MultiPL-E和LiveCodeBench上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: Agnostics简化了多语言代码的后训练流程，为低资源语言的LLM应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

Conclusion: HNO通过希尔伯特变换提供了一种新的神经算子架构，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在理论上得到了支持。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

Result: 高斯混合层在简单分类任务中表现与全连接网络相当，且行为显著不同。

Conclusion: 高斯混合层为神经网络提供了新的设计思路，展示了与传统层不同的动态行为。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

Motivation: 准确的水位预测对生态系统管理至关重要，但现有深度学习模型在水文领域的应用不足且泛化能力有限。

Method: 引入RAF框架，通过检索历史多变量水文事件来丰富模型输入，无需任务特定的重新训练或微调。

Result: 在Everglades的真实数据上验证，RAF显著提高了水位预测的准确性。

Conclusion: RAF方法在水文领域具有潜力，为生态系统管理中自适应AI方法的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用Transformer模型检测仇恨语音的有效性，使用MetaHate数据集评估了BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA等模型，其中ELECTRA表现最佳（F1分数：0.8980）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨语音在社交媒体上广泛存在，对社会、心理和个体造成严重危害，需要开发高效的自动检测方法。

Method: 研究采用Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA）在MetaHate数据集上进行仇恨语音检测。

Result: ELECTRA模型表现最佳，F1分数达到0.8980，但分类错误显示在讽刺、隐晦语言和标签噪声方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在仇恨语音检测中表现出色，ELECTRA尤为突出，但仍需解决讽刺和隐晦语言等问题。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

TL;DR: ASkDAgger框架通过利用新手计划的反馈，减少人类教学努力，提高交互式模仿学习的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少交互式模仿学习中人类教学的努力，利用新手计划中的信息（如能力和不确定性）优化学习过程。

Method: 提出ASkDAgger框架，包含S-Aware Gating (SAG)、Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER)和Prioritized Interactive Experience Replay (PIER)三个组件。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中验证了ASkDAgger的有效性，减少了查询频率和演示标注需求，提高了泛化能力和适应速度。

Conclusion: ASkDAgger通过利用新手计划反馈，显著提升了交互式模仿学习的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏统一的平台，难以公平系统地评估深度主动学习算法在复杂场景（如分布偏移和数据不平衡）下的表现。

Method: 开发ALScope平台，整合多领域数据集和算法，支持灵活配置实验条件（如OOD样本比例和类别不平衡比例）。

Result: 实验发现：1）算法性能因领域和任务设置差异显著；2）非标准场景下算法仍有改进空间；3）部分算法性能好但耗时较长。

Conclusion: ALScope为深度主动学习研究提供了统一评估平台，揭示了算法在不同场景下的表现差异和改进方向。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时语音翻译系统需要在翻译质量和延迟之间找到平衡，现有方法难以同时优化这两者。

Method: 提出REINA损失函数，基于信息理论训练自适应策略，利用非流式翻译模型优化延迟与质量的权衡。

Result: 在多语言任务中，REINA显著提升了延迟与质量的权衡（最高21%），并达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: REINA为实时语音翻译系统提供了一种高效的优化方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEA的新框架，通过分解集成误差为个体性能和多样性两部分，实现了对集成学习性能的精细调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集成学习方法（如Bagging和Boosting）缺乏对准确性与多样性权衡的精确控制，而NCL方法虽有尝试但理论界限松散且调整范围有限。

Method: SEA框架将集成误差分解为个体性能项和多样性项，通过引入可调参数实现对两者的精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，SEA在多个公开数据集上优于基线方法，且具有更灵活的调整能力和更稳定的多样性变化。

Conclusion: SEA通过理论上的紧界限和实验验证，提供了一种更有效的集成学习性能调控方法。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

Motivation: 研究如何在去中心化算法中同时利用动量加速和压缩通信的优势，以解决非凸随机优化问题。

Method: 设计了两种算法：1）梯度有界时的压缩去中心化自适应方法；2）数据异构时的压缩去中心化重球方法，结合梯度跟踪技术。

Result: 两种方法均实现了最优收敛速率，并在训练深度神经网络和Transformer中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实践中均表现出色，为去中心化优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG基础模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，且多局限于时域分析，忽略了信号处理中的确定性特征提取方法。

Method: MENDR采用滤波器组和黎曼流形变换器架构，通过小波包变换分解EEG信号为多分辨率系数，学习对称正定矩阵嵌入。

Result: MENDR在多个临床EEG任务中接近最先进性能，参数更少，支持信号重建和几何可视化。

Conclusion: MENDR为高效、可解释且临床适用的EEG分析提供了潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

Result: 在基准问题和实时车辆轨迹估计任务中验证了RCUKF的有效性。

Conclusion: RCUKF框架在复杂系统建模中表现出色，尤其在数据驱动模型可能失效的高维或混沌场景中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中容易受到虚假相关性的影响，导致模型依赖统计捷径而非真实因果关系，影响泛化能力。

Method: 将多模态输入建模为多关系图，捕捉模态内和模态间依赖；使用注意力机制分离因果特征和捷径特征；通过后门调整动态结合特征以稳定预测。

Result: 在多个标准数据集和OOD测试集上验证，MMCI有效抑制偏差并提升性能。

Conclusion: MMCI通过因果干预解决了多模态情感分析中的虚假相关性问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量人工标注的任务和标签，限制了AI系统超越人类智能的能力。

Method: R-Zero通过初始化两个独立模型（Challenger和Solver），让它们通过交互共同进化，生成自适应的训练课程。

Result: R-Zero显著提升了推理能力，例如在数学推理和通用推理任务上分别提升了6.49和7.54分。

Conclusion: R-Zero为LLM的自主进化提供了一种有效方法，突破了依赖人工标注的瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，SPaRFT在多个推理基准测试中达到或超越现有方法，同时减少高达100倍的样本需求。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据选择和自适应训练课程，SPaRFT能以最小资源释放LLM的强大推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Result: KNOW策略在多种数据集和架构上表现优于朴素微调和简单权重预测。

Conclusion: 通过重新解释遗忘动态，为深度学习中的知识传递提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Result: 在多种节点和图分类、回归任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 联合学习能量函数和切向流对图神经网络有效。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

multimodal policies can achieve tighter generalization bounds and more
favorable optimization landscapes than their unimodal counterparts. We provide
a comprehensive review of theoretical frameworks that explain why multimodal

*Linxiao Yang,Xinyu Gu,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据归因方法Integrated Influence，通过引入基线数据集和退化过程，解决了现有方法局部解释和缺乏基线的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LOO的数据归因方法存在局部解释和缺乏基线的问题，限制了其灵活性和解释能力。

Method: 提出Integrated Influence方法，定义基线数据集，通过数据退化过程累积样本影响，并建立理论框架。

Result: 实验表明，Integrated Influence在数据归因和错误标注识别任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Integrated Influence提供了更可靠的数据归因，增强了机器学习模型的透明度。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

### [106] [Cold Start Active Preference Learning in Socio-Economic Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05090)
*Mojtaba Fayaz-Bakhsh,Danial Ataee,MohammadAmin Fazli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决冷启动问题的主动偏好学习框架，通过自监督预训练和主动学习循环提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动问题，即在无初始标记数据时性能下降的问题，适用于标记数据稀缺且昂贵的领域。

Method: 结合PCA自监督预训练生成初始伪标签，再通过主动学习循环优化模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于标准主动学习方法，准确率更高且所需标记数据更少。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了冷启动问题，提高了偏好学习在数据受限环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

### [107] [Learning from Similarity-Confidence and Confidence-Difference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05108)
*Tomoya Tate,Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督学习框架，通过整合多种弱监督信号（相似性-置信度和置信度-差异）来提升模型性能，特别是在标记数据有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标记数据有限且标签不准确的情况下，现有弱监督学习方法通常只利用单一类型的弱监督信号，无法充分利用多角度的监督信息。

Method: 提出了SconfConfDiff分类方法，整合了两种弱标签（相似性-置信度和置信度-差异），并设计了两种无偏风险估计器（基于现有估计器的凸组合和新设计的交互模型）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种设置下均优于现有基线方法，且理论分析证明了其鲁棒性和收敛性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合互补的弱监督信号，显著提升了弱监督学习的性能，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的强化学习框架，通过策略熵探索优化函数调用任务，解决了探索不足、推理结构缺失和参数验证不足的问题，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练方法在函数调用任务中表现不佳，监督微调依赖模式匹配，强化学习难以处理复杂动作空间。

Method: 采用两阶段数据准备流程，结合LLM评估和抽象语法树验证，提出基于策略熵的探索框架。

Result: 在Berkeley函数调用排行榜上达到86.02%准确率，比标准GRPO高6%。

Conclusion: 该方法在代码预训练模型上表现突出，表明结构化语言生成能力对强化学习有益。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

*Thinh Nguyen,Trung Phan,Binh T. Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization (HFedDG)场景，并提出了HFedATM方法，通过优化传输对齐和正则化聚合提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分层联邦学习（HFL）中的域偏移问题，提升模型在未见目标域上的性能。

Method: 提出HFedATM方法，包括Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment和Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation。

Result: HFedATM显著提升了FedDG基线的性能，并保持了计算和通信效率。

Conclusion: HFedATM通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了其在域偏移问题上的优越性和高效性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在逼近偏微分方程弱解时的性能，填补神经网络在PDE误差估计理论中的空白。

Method: 使用常用和通用的激活函数，在Sobolev空间中分析深度神经网络的逼近误差。

Result: 深度网络在W^{m,p}范数下的逼近误差优于有限元和谱方法，表现出超收敛现象。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络在科学计算中的应用提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSEO框架通过优化后验堆叠集成，结合多样性和性能选择基础模型，并在超参数空间中搜索最优集成策略，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML系统在集成阶段采用固定策略，无法适应任务特性，PSEO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过二元二次规划选择基础模型，引入多层堆叠机制，并在超参数空间中搜索最优集成策略。

Result: 在80个公开数据集上，PSEO的平均测试排名（2.96）优于16种现有方法。

Conclusion: PSEO通过自适应集成策略显著提升了AutoML系统的性能。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于ABMs/RABMs的复杂性和随机性，以及缺乏标准化的RL评估指标，研究旨在开发领域驱动的RL指标以改进性能评估。

Method: 结合领域驱动的奖励与传统及前沿指标，应用于理性ABM疫情建模案例（如口罩使用、疫苗接种和封锁政策）。

Result: 结果表明，领域驱动的奖励与传统指标结合，在不同模拟场景（如口罩供应差异）中表现良好。

Conclusion: 领域驱动的RL指标为ABMs/RABMs的性能评估提供了有效工具，尤其在复杂系统建模中具有潜力。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法假设客户端静态参与，而实际场景中客户端可能动态加入，这带来了性能保持和知识迁移的挑战。

Method: 提出pFedDSH框架，利用中央超网络生成个性化模型，采用批次特定掩码保护现有客户端知识，并通过数据重放策略实现反向知识迁移。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上的实验表明，pFedDSH优于现有方法，实现了现有客户端的性能稳定和新客户端的快速适应。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在动态客户端加入场景中表现优异，兼顾性能稳定性和资源效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIA（启发式引导的推理时对齐）是一种无需调优、兼容黑盒的方法，通过轻量级提示优化器和启发式奖励模型，减少推理调用同时保持对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时通常忽视对齐质量与计算成本之间的平衡，HIA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HIA使用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤，减少推理调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上，HIA在相同推理预算下优于其他基线方法，且在低推理预算下仍有效。

Conclusion: HIA为可扩展、个性化的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Motivation: 当前基于EEG的AAD缺乏能效约束下的协同框架，无法充分利用互补的EEG特征。

Method: 提出S$^2$M-Former框架，包括脉冲驱动的对称架构和轻量级1D令牌序列，减少参数和能耗。

Result: 在三个AAD基准测试中，S$^2$M-Former达到SOTA解码精度，参数减少14.7倍，能耗降低5.8倍。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former是一种高效、低功耗的AAD解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art

outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet为复杂时间依赖PDE的长期可靠积分提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

TL;DR: Fairy±i是首个针对复数值大语言模型（LLM）的2位量化框架，通过提升全精度模型的精度上限并高效量化至2位，超越了现有方法的性能上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练（QAT）研究仅关注最小化全精度模型的量化误差，未尝试突破其精度上限。本文旨在打破这一限制。

Method: 利用复数域的表示优势，将权重映射到第四单位根{±1, ±i}，形成对称且信息最优的2位表示，实现无需乘法的推理。

Result: Fairy±i在PPL和下游任务上优于现有2位量化方法的精度上限，同时保持存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为极低位约束下构建高精度实用LLM开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BAR的竞价感知检索框架，通过将广告竞价价值纳入检索评分函数，解决了多阶段不一致问题，提升了平台收入和广告效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动竞价策略的普及，检索阶段与排名阶段之间的不一致性加剧，导致平台收入和广告效果不理想。

Method: BAR框架通过竞价感知建模（包括单调性约束学习和多任务蒸馏）和经济一致性表示，结合异步近线推理实现实时更新，并通过任务专注细化模块增强特征交互。

Result: 在阿里巴巴展示广告平台上的大规模部署表明，BAR实现了平台收入增长4.32%，正向操作广告的展示量提升22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR通过解决多阶段不一致问题，显著提升了广告系统的性能和经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Conclusion: LLMs结合迭代学习可有效生成CPs，为临床决策支持提供新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉钻井数据的复杂动态和高维特性，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 采用LSTM、Transformer、TS-Mixer和注意力机制的混合架构，建模时间依赖性和特征交互。

Result: 模型在真实数据集上表现优异，R-squared达0.9988，MAPE为1.447%。

Conclusion: 该混合方法为实时ROP预测提供了可靠解决方案，具有显著的工程应用价值。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据中存在选择偏差，导致治疗组间协变量分布不平衡，传统倾向得分加权方法（如IPW）在倾向得分方差大时效果不佳。

Method: 提出Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)，利用去混淆因子构建稳定权重，优先选择低混淆样本，减少高混淆样本的影响。

Result: DFW在真实和合成数据集上优于IPW和CBPS，实现了更好的协变量平衡和治疗效果估计。

Conclusion: DFW是一种有效的倾向得分加权方法，适用于二元和多治疗场景，能显著提升选择偏差处理和治疗效果估计的稳定性。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

Motivation: 传统集中式联邦学习存在单点故障、个性化不足和对分布变化的脆弱性等问题，需要更灵活、鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用P2P拓扑结构，通过本地验证集计算一致性得分，选择个性化更新集合并引入正则化项。

Conclusion: 去中心化的P2P框架LIGHTYEAR通过个性化更新选择和正则化，显著提升了联邦学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: 传统PEFT方法（如LoRA）与基础模型架构紧密耦合，限制了其在异构预训练大语言模型中的适用性。

Method: Cross-LoRA通过LoRA-Align（子空间对齐）和LoRA-Shift（权重投影）实现模块迁移，无需额外数据或训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Cross-LoRA相对基础模型提升高达5.26%，性能接近直接训练的LoRA适配器。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA提供了一种高效、轻量的跨模型LoRA迁移方法，扩展了PEFT的适用性。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE)方法，用于压缩大型MoE模型，显著减少了参数数量且仅带来微小的精度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MoE架构在扩展大型语言模型方面表现出色，但其部署时的高内存需求成为主要挑战。现有压缩方法在精度上表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: MoBE通过将专家矩阵分解为独特矩阵A和共享基矩阵B的线性组合，并通过最小化重构误差来学习分解。

Result: 实验表明，MoBE在减少24%-30%参数的同时，仅带来1%-2%的精度下降，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoBE是一种高效且低损失的MoE模型压缩方法，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在泛化性、适应性和计算效率方面表现不佳，FlowState旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FlowState采用状态空间模型（SSM）编码器和函数基解码器，支持连续时间建模和动态时间尺度调整。

Result: FlowState在GIFT-ZS和Chronos-ZS基准测试中表现最优，且模型更小、数据需求更低、效率更高。

Conclusion: FlowState通过创新设计和高效预训练策略，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Conclusion: 隐式信号对齐能高效实现CRS的可扩展和用户自适应设计。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that

Conclusion: 研究为大规模批量训练提供了理论指导和实用建议。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Conclusion: 通过动态调整批次大小和学习率，可以有效加速SGD的收敛，减少训练成本。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

### [135] [Optimal Corpus Aware Training for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05364)
*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCAT（Optimal Corpus Aware Training）通过微调CAT预训练模型，仅调整少量语料相关参数，提升模型准确性，同时避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAT方法在训练前需预定义高质量数据组，易出错且效率低。OCAT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: OCAT冻结大部分模型参数，仅微调少量语料相关参数，实现轻量级优化。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别提升chrF分数3.6和1.8，且对超参数设置不敏感。

Conclusion: OCAT是一种高效、稳健的微调方法，性能优于或与现有技术相当。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种放宽潜在老虎机假设的方法，仅需动作偏好排序模型，而非完整的奖励分布，以应对个体间奖励尺度差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决潜在老虎机算法在个性化任务中因个体奖励尺度差异而性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出一种后验采样算法，仅需动作偏好排序模型，放宽对奖励分布的要求。

Result: 算法在奖励分布明确时表现与潜在老虎机相当，在奖励尺度差异时表现更优。

Conclusion: 放宽假设的潜在老虎机算法在个性化任务中更具鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

*Jie Xiao,Shaoduo Gan,Changyuan Fan,Qingnan Ren,Alfred Long,Yuchen Zhang,Rymon Yu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo是一个RL系统，通过将轨迹采样和策略优化解耦到异构的“推理”和“训练”集群上，解决了现代RL后训练中的串行上下文切换问题，同时保持了统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基于RL的LLM后训练将轨迹采样和策略优化放在同一GPU集群上，导致系统需要在推理和训练工作负载之间切换，违反了分布式训练系统的SPMD假设。

Method: Echo引入了两种轻量级同步协议：顺序拉取模式和异步推送-拉取模式，分别用于最小化偏差和最大化硬件利用率。

Result: 在分布式集群上训练三种代表性RL工作负载时，Echo在收敛速度和最终奖励方面与完全共置的Verl基线相当，同时将轨迹生成卸载到边缘硬件。

Conclusion: Echo展示了利用分散异构资源实现数据中心级性能的可能性，为LLM的大规模RL训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受后门攻击，需要一种高效的防御方法。

Method: 采用非目标标签训练（NT）和互学习（ML），通过教师模型和学生模型的协作净化模型。

Result: 实验证明NT-ML能有效抵御6种后门攻击，优于5种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种高效的后门防御机制，适用于少量干净样本的场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率是深度学习中的关键超参数，其理想值可能随训练过程变化。研究旨在探讨动态调整学习率的自适应机制的实用价值。

Method: 重新审视了2017年提出的基于累积路径的自适应方案，修正了其与Adam优化器的不一致问题，并提出了一种改进版本。

Result: 通过比较SGD和Adam（带或不带累积自适应）以及另一种最新方法，评估了自适应策略的实际效果。

Conclusion: 研究旨在明确自适应学习率策略在何时及为何能带来实际优势。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的因果关系感知框架，结合Causality-Aware Transformer和Variational Mean Flow，解决了分子生成任务中高质量、多样性和快速推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分子生成任务中难以同时保证高质量、多样性和快速推理，因此需要一种新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 使用Causality-Aware Transformer（CAT）联合编码分子图标记和文本指令，并在生成过程中强制因果依赖。2. 开发Variational Mean Flow（VMF）框架，将潜在空间建模为高斯混合模型，增强表达能力。

Result: 在四个标准分子基准测试中，模型表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的新颖性（74.5%）、多样性（70.3%）和100%的有效性。VMF在条件生成中仅需一次函数评估（NFE），无条件生成中最多五次NFE，计算效率显著优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的因果关系感知框架在分子生成任务中表现出色，同时实现了高质量、多样性和高效推理。

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ESN在极端波动和混沌时期具有优势，是预测加密货币价格的有效工具。

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

TL;DR: NegBio-VAE扩展了VAE框架，使用负二项分布建模神经活动的尖峰计数，解决了Poisson-VAE中均值与方差相等的刚性约束问题，显著提高了重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE无法准确建模神经活动的变异性，而Poisson-VAE的Poisson分布约束过于刚性，未能反映真实的神经活动随机性。

Method: 引入NegBio-VAE，使用负二项分布建模尖峰计数，开发了两种ELBO优化方案和两种可微分重参数化策略。

Result: 通过增加一个离散参数，NegBio-VAE显著提高了重建精度，证明了建模过离散的重要性。

Conclusion: NegBio-VAE通过负二项分布更准确地建模神经活动，为神经表示提供了更广泛且精确的框架。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

TL;DR: CR-FMOL是一个新的联邦多目标学习框架，通过偏好锥约束实现客户端公平性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中多数客户端优化导致少数客户端被忽视的问题。

Method: 采用锥约束的多目标优化框架，结合FMGDA/FSMGDA步骤和服务器端的Pareto-MTL子问题求解。

Result: 在非IID数据上提升客户端公平性，早期性能略低于FedAvg，但长期可达到相近精度。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL是首个实现客户端Pareto最优的联邦多目标学习框架，具有潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在广泛任务中表现出色，但在专业领域仍需针对性训练。现有方法如GRPO虽高效，但忽略了候选响应间的语义交互。

Method: 引入结构因果模型（SCM）揭示候选响应间的隐藏依赖关系，提出GCPO方法，结合因果奖励调整和KL正则化项。

Result: GCPO在多个推理基准测试中表现优于现有方法（包括GRPO）。

Conclusion: GCPO通过整合因果结构优化策略，显著提升了模型性能，为专业领域任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS仅关注预期收益，无法有效控制高风险尾部风险，可能导致严重后果。

Method: 1. CVaR-MCTS：嵌入CVaR以控制尾部风险；2. W-MCTS：引入Wasserstein模糊集解决样本偏差。

Result: 实验证明两种方法优于现有基线，实现了稳健的尾部风险控制，同时提高了奖励和稳定性。

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS为MCTS提供了严格的尾部风险保障，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Conclusion: MLES是一种有前景的可解释控制策略发现方法，克服了领域特定语言的限制，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在能源时间序列预测中受限于多尺度时间动态和真实数据的不规则性，无法满足高精度和可靠性的需求。

Method: 提出EnergyPatchTST，包含多尺度特征提取、概率预测框架（蒙特卡洛消除）、未来已知变量集成路径及预训练微调策略。

Result: 在常见能源数据集上，EnergyPatchTST预测误差降低7-12%，并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST为能源领域时间序列预测提供了重要参考，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

TL;DR: MoMA是一种新型架构，利用多模态EHR数据和多个LLM代理进行临床预测任务，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态EHR数据能提供更丰富的患者健康信息，但整合这些数据用于临床预测仍具挑战性。

Method: MoMA使用专门的LLM代理将非文本模态转换为结构化文本摘要，再通过聚合代理生成统一的多模态摘要，最后由预测代理生成临床预测。

Result: 在三种预测任务中，MoMA的表现优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MoMA在多模态EHR数据的临床预测任务中表现出更高的准确性和灵活性。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需真实标签评估AI系统的方法，利用游戏抵抗性与输出质量的关系，证明了f-互信息是唯一满足自然条件的游戏抵抗机制，并在多个领域验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统评估常依赖真实标签，但真实标签难以获取。论文旨在开发一种无需真实标签的评估机制，利用游戏抵抗性与输出质量的关系。

Method: 通过数据处理不等式证明游戏抵抗性与信息内容和任务性能的关系，提出f-互信息作为唯一满足自然条件的游戏抵抗机制。

Result: 在翻译、同行评审等十个领域中，信息论机制能完美区分忠实与策略性代理，且对抗操纵的鲁棒性比现有方法高10-100倍。

Conclusion: f-互信息机制在无需真实标签的情况下有效评估AI系统，尤其在压缩比为10:1时性能最佳，为评估提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Hessian的正则化方法，用于训练概率电路（PCs），以避免过拟合并提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着PCs的表达能力增强，过拟合问题在数据有限时变得显著。论文从对数似然景观角度分析过拟合，发现其常由收敛到尖锐极值点引起。

Method: 受神经网络中锐度感知最小化的启发，提出了一种Hessian迹的正则化方法，该方法可高效计算并用于PCs训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能引导PCs趋向平坦极值点，显著提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: Hessian迹正则化是一种有效的方法，可改善PCs的训练效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多任务循环神经网络，用于联合建模电子健康记录中的观察间隔和缺失过程，以提高临床预测模型的性能和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床存在（clinical presence）影响观察结果，但现有预测模型常忽略这一点，导致性能和可迁移性受限。

Method: 采用多任务循环神经网络，同时建模观察间隔、缺失过程和生存结局。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的死亡率预测任务中，该方法优于未考虑观察过程的先进模型。

Conclusion: 利用临床存在可提升预测模型的性能和可迁移性。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在广泛任务中表现出色，但在特定下游任务中表现不佳，且缺乏无监督适应的系统性综述。

Method: 提出基于无标签视觉数据可用性和性质的分类法，将方法分为四种范式：数据自由迁移、无监督域迁移、批量测试时适应和在线测试时适应。

Result: 建立了对无监督VLM适应的系统性理解，并总结了代表性基准和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了无监督VLM适应领域的空白，为未来研究提供了框架和资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

Motivation: 解决多视图聚类中高维特征和无关信息管理的挑战，传统方法依赖手动调参且缺乏跨视图集成机制。

Method: 引入熵正则化替代模糊化参数，利用信噪比加权和双级熵项自动平衡视图与特征贡献，AAMVFCM-U进一步通过自适应阈值实现层次降维。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于15种先进方法，AAMVFCM-U计算效率提升97%，降维至原始尺寸的0.45%，并自动识别关键视图组合。

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需手动调参，通过自适应机制显著提升多视图聚类的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

Motivation: 当前强化学习管道存在优势崩溃和滚动静默问题，导致梯度更新不理想，影响长期学习效率。

Method: 提出Shuffle-R1框架，包括成对轨迹采样和基于优势的轨迹重组，以优化梯度信号和批次组成。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Shuffle-R1显著优于现有强化学习方法，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的调整对提升多模态大语言模型的强化学习效率至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VFL是一种新型垂直联邦学习框架，解决了数据样本未对齐和缺失特征的问题，并支持本地独立推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VFL需要数据样本完全对齐且不支持本地独立推理，X-VFL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了XCom模块完成缺失特征，DS-Align模块对齐决策子空间特征，支持本地推理。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MIMIC-III数据集上分别提升15%和43%的准确率。

Conclusion: X-VFL在缺失特征和本地推理场景中表现优越。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

Result: TrajEvo在多个真实数据集上优于现有启发式方法，并在未见过的OOD数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: TrajEvo为快速、可解释且泛化性强的轨迹预测启发式方法设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

Motivation: 知识图谱嵌入模型需要正负样本进行训练，但缺乏高级负采样策略的支持，现有库功能有限。

Method: 开发了一个PyKEEN扩展，集成静态和动态负采样策略，提供模块化架构。

Result: 扩展不仅增强了PyKEEN，还简化了嵌入方法的开发和定制，并通过实验验证了其对链接预测任务性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该扩展为知识图谱嵌入提供了更有效的负采样策略，并为进一步优化策略设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Conclusion: 单毒假设成立，为后门攻击提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过对抗性棋盘游戏评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，弥补了主流问答基准方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 棋盘游戏作为战略推理的典型领域，可用于评估AI系统的综合性能，尤其是LLM在对抗性环境中的表现。

Method: 开发了Qi Town平台，支持5种游戏和20个LLM驱动的玩家，使用Elo评分系统和性能循环图（PLG）定量评估LLM能力，并通过积极情绪评分（PSS）评估心理适应性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管技术差异显著，LLM在对抗性环境中表现出比人类更强的适应性和乐观态度，但PLG揭示了其技能发挥的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了新视角，揭示了其在对抗性环境中的优势和不足，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

TL;DR: 研究比较了三种实现自主网络地理信息系统（AWebGIS）的方法，发现基于小型语言模型（SLM）的客户端离线方法在准确性和隐私保护方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）方案在隐私、可扩展性和互联网依赖方面的局限性。

Method: 比较三种方法：1) 基于云LLM的在线方法；2) 半自动离线方法（传统机器学习）；3) 基于SLM的完全离线客户端方法。

Result: SLM方法准确率最高（0.93），且显著减轻服务器负担。

Conclusion: 客户端执行的SLM模型是AWebGIS的可行解决方案，兼顾性能与隐私。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在理想化设置下评估LLMs推理能力，忽视了现实中的非理想场景，如摘要推理、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤。

Method: 通过RL微调三种LLMs和一个大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），并在八种公共数据集上测试其性能。

Result: RL微调在理想化设置下提升推理能力，但在非理想场景中表现显著下降，暴露了推理能力的局限性。

Conclusion: 大模型的推理能力常被高估，需在非理想场景下评估模型性能。代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖静态策略，无法成为更好的战略规划者，限制了在复杂领域（如医疗健康）的应用。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，通过元级进化机制自主优化问题解决策略，并开发EHRFlowBench基准进行可重复评估。

Result: 实验表明，HealthFlow的自我进化方法显著优于现有代理框架。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者向自我进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主有效的科学发现AI铺平道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论的新型分子对接框架（Docking Game），通过LoopPlay算法显著提升了对接精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接模型在配体对接中表现不佳，主要由于配体和蛋白质结构复杂性的差异。

Method: 将蛋白-配体互动建模为双玩家博弈，开发LoopPlay算法，通过内外循环交替训练玩家。

Result: 实验显示LoopPlay在预测准确结合模式上比现有方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提高药物发现中分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

Result: LLMs在减少对空间推理依赖时表现优异，审查-优化方法能有效纠正错误。

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的有效替代，未来研究方向包括后训练和多模态整合。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Result: 在WebArena测试中，CogniWeb达到43.96%的成功率，并减少75%的token使用。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过双系统整合，在Web导航任务中实现了高效与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

Conclusion: MedMKEB将作为标准基准，推动可信且高效的医学知识编辑算法发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Motivation: 模拟电路设计耗时且依赖经验，现有AI方法通用性差且计算资源消耗大。

Method: 结合Qwen3-8B模型和启发式搜索（DE和PSO），动态构建任务特定损失函数。

Result: 在多个工艺节点上表现优异，优于AutoCkt，减少86.67%任务的计算资源。

Conclusion: EasySize能显著简化模拟电路设计流程，减少对人力和计算资源的依赖。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Conclusion: HGNN模型在事件日志修复中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态混合检索策略，有效解决了复杂VQA任务中的知识获取和推理问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中符号与神经模块松散耦合的问题，提供更统一、可解释的推理系统。

Method: 将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入统一推理系统，LLM处理归纳推理和规划，中央协调器维护状态一致性。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）和ARC（+6.0%）。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在开放式多智能体环境中的行为，尤其是在法律和伦理困境中的表现，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入NomicLaw模拟系统，让LLM协作制定法律规则，通过投票和语言策略分析其行为。

Result: 实验显示LLM能自发形成联盟、背叛信任，并调整语言策略影响集体决策，展现了社会推理和说服能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源LLM的潜在社会推理能力，为未来AI系统在自主谈判和立法中的应用提供了设计思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

TL;DR: 论文研究了描述逻辑（DLs）中的极小模型推理问题，发现即使在简单的DL（如$\mathcal{EL}$）中，概念在极小模型中的可满足性也是不可判定的。通过引入无环性条件，部分恢复了可判定性，并探讨了DL-Lite家族的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极小模型推理在知识表示中具有核心地位，但在描述逻辑中的研究有限，尤其是纯极小模型的情况。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究了纯极小模型在流行DL中的表现，分析了概念可满足性的不可判定性，并通过无环性条件恢复可判定性。

Result: 发现$\mathcal{EL}$中的概念可满足性在极小模型中不可判定，但在无环性条件下可判定，且复杂度低于双指数时间。DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$的扩展被证明是ExpSpace难的。

Conclusion: 极小模型推理在描述逻辑中具有高度复杂性，但通过限制条件（如无环性）可以部分恢复可判定性。DL-Lite家族的扩展复杂性较高。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

TL;DR: StructVRM通过结构化可验证奖励模型改进多模态推理任务，提供细粒度反馈，显著提升模型在复杂问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励机制对复杂多问题推理任务反馈过于粗糙，无法有效指导模型学习部分正确性。

Method: 引入StructVRM，基于模型验证器提供细粒度、子问题级别的反馈，评估语义和数学等价性。

Result: Seed-StructVRM在12个多模态基准中的6个及新STEM-Bench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 结构化可验证奖励训练是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实时数据驱动的智能交通系统预测性维护方法，通过在线处理流水线实现高精度故障预测，并首次结合自然语言和可视化解释。实验结果显示F-measure超过98%，准确率达99%，验证了方法的有效性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为智能交通系统提供实时、高精度的预测性维护解决方案，以提升铁路运营的安全性和效率。

Method: 采用包含样本预处理、增量分类和结果解释的在线处理流水线，结合统计和频率特征提取以及解释性模块。

Result: 在MetroPT数据集上，F-measure达98%以上，准确率达99%，且在处理类别不平衡和噪声时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在铁路预测性维护中具有实际应用价值，能快速识别故障迹象并支持决策，提升服务可用性和安全性。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Motivation: 现有的VLMs在复杂动态环境中缺乏细节关注和精确行动规划能力，而真实任务需要高级空间推理和长期规划，但实际评估成本高昂。

Method: 提出DeepPHY框架，通过一系列模拟环境系统评估VLMs对物理原理的理解，包含多难度环境和细粒度指标。

Result: 评估发现，即使是先进的VLMs也难以将物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: DeepPHY为评估VLMs的物理推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Result: 研究发现AI对齐需结合时空背景，避免脱离统计现实，如文本到图像模型中的性别比例问题。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Motivation: 随着通用AI模型的快速发展及欧盟AI法案的实施，现有评估工具无法满足系统性风险的测量需求，亟需填补这一“基准-法规差距”。

Method: 引入Bench-2-CoP框架，通过LLM-as-judge分析，将194,955个基准问题映射到欧盟AI法案的能力分类中。

Result: 发现评估生态严重偏向行为倾向（如幻觉倾向和歧视性偏见），而关键功能能力（如规避人类监督）完全未被覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究为政策制定者和开发者提供了填补评估差距的关键见解，以促进更安全、合规的AI发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Motivation: 解决ERC数据稀缺、来源偏见和标签主观性问题，探索LLM在数据生成中的应用。

Method: 利用小型通用LLM合成六个新数据集，补充三个主流ERC基准，并评估其对分类和标签不平衡的影响。

Result: 生成的显著提升了ERC分类模型的鲁棒性，并在现有基准上实现了性能改进。

Conclusion: 小型LLM生成的多样化数据集能有效补充ERC任务，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

TL;DR: InfiAlign是一种高效的后训练框架，结合监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO），通过多维质量指标自动筛选高质量数据，显著提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，同时减少数据需求。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或任务特定策略，难以扩展且资源密集，需改进样本效率。

Method: 提出InfiAlign框架，整合SFT和DPO，通过自动数据选择管道从开源推理数据集中筛选高质量数据。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，仅用12%训练数据即达到竞争性能，数学推理任务提升3.89%。

Conclusion: 结合数据选择和全阶段后训练，为大规模推理模型对齐提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）时表现有限，且图检索方法难以平衡全局结构和精确控制。

Result: 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，GRAIL平均准确率提升21.01%，F1提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过交互式检索范式，有效平衡检索广度和精度，显著提升知识图谱推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如LLM-as-a-Judge）仅关注最终输出，忽略了逐步推理过程，而Agent-as-a-Judge系统通常局限于特定领域。需要一种通用框架来弥补这一不足。

Method: 设计了一个模块化框架，将任务分解为子任务，验证每个步骤，并聚合模块输出以生成最终评估结果。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准测试中，提出的Judge Agent比基于GPT-4o的LLM-as-a-Judge基线分别提高了4.76%和10.52%的评估一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通用评估方法的潜力，能够更准确地预测任务完成情况。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Conclusion: LearnerAgent能有效模拟真实学习场景，揭示LLM行为特征，为心理学和智能系统研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.
