Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究者提出了模型合成架构(MSA)，结合分布式表示和符号表示来构建针对新情况的定制化心理模型，该方法在模拟人类开放式推理方面优于仅使用语言模型的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在面对新情况时能够从广泛的背景知识中调动相关信息进行推理和预测，但目前缺乏有效的计算模型来解释这种全局相关信息检索和连贯推理的能力。

Method: 提出模型合成架构(MSA)，使用语言模型实现基于全局相关性的检索和模型合成，使用概率程序实现定制化、连贯的世界模型，结合分布式和符号表示来构建针对新情况的心理模型。

Result: 在"模型奥林匹克"体育场景数据集上的评估显示，MSA方法在捕捉人类判断方面优于仅使用语言模型的基线方法，无论是在直接生成还是思维链生成模式下都表现更好。

Conclusion: MSA能够镜像人类在全局相关变量上进行局部连贯推理的能力，为理解和复制人类在开放式领域中的推理提供了一条路径，证明了结合分布式和符号表示的有效性。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过识别语言模型中的模态差异向量，揭示了模型在模态分类上的能力优于先前研究，并探讨了这些向量与人类分类行为的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型（LMs）在模态分类任务中的可靠性，并探索其与人类分类行为的潜在联系。

Method: 识别和分析语言模型中的模态差异向量，研究其在不同训练阶段的表现，并与人类分类行为进行对比。

Result: 发现模态差异向量能更可靠地分类模态，且其出现顺序与模型能力提升一致；这些向量还能模拟人类细粒度分类行为。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性技术，为语言模型和人类模态分类提供了新见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

### [4] [Improving Drug Identification in Overdose Death Surveillance using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12679)
*Arthur J. Funnell,Panayiotis Petousis,Fabrice Harel-Canada,Ruby Romero,Alex A. T. Bui,Adam Koncsol,Hritika Chaturvedi,Chelsea Shover,David Goodman-Meza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用NLP技术（特别是BioClinicalBERT）从自由文本验尸报告中自动分类药物过量死亡，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国药物过量死亡（尤其是芬太尼相关）的快速增加需要更及时和准确的监测方法，而传统ICD-10编码存在延迟和信息丢失的问题。

Method: 使用35,433条2020年的死亡记录进行模型训练和内部测试，并在3,335条2023-2024年的新数据集上进行外部验证。评估了多种NLP方法，包括传统分类器、BERT、BioClinicalBERT及大型语言模型（如Qwen 3和Llama 3）。

Result: BioClinicalBERT在内部测试集上表现近乎完美（宏F1≥0.998），外部验证也表现优异（宏F1=0.966），优于传统方法和通用BERT模型。

Conclusion: NLP模型（尤其是BioClinicalBERT）能高效准确地分类药物过量死亡，显著提升监测速度，支持实时检测新趋势。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

### [5] [AdaptiSent: Context-Aware Adaptive Attention for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12695)
*S M Rafiuddin,Sadia Kamal,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptiSent是一种新的多模态基于方面的情感分析框架，通过自适应跨模态注意力机制提升情感分类和方面词提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多模态情感分析中难以有效捕捉文本与图像间的复杂交互，AdaptiSent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力机制，优化文本与视觉信息的交互提取。

Result: 在标准Twitter数据集上，AdaptiSent在精确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有模型，尤其在复杂多模态关系识别中表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为多模态基于方面的情感分析设定了新标准，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

### [6] [AudioJudge: Understanding What Works in Large Audio Model Based Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12705)
*Potsawee Manakul,Woody Haosheng Gan,Michael J. Ryan,Ali Sartaz Khan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Kunat Pipatanakul,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AudioJudge，利用大型音频模型（LAM）作为统一评估框架，解决现有语音评估的局限性，包括音频特征检测和人类偏好模拟。通过多任务探索和提示工程优化，性能显著提升，并引入多角度集成方法，实现通用音频评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音评估存在两大问题：针对不同音频特征需设计专用系统，且自动评估方法与人类偏好相关性差。研究旨在探索LAM能否提供统一框架解决这些问题。

Method: 系统研究LAM作为评估工具（AudioJudge），探索其在音频特征检测（如发音、语速）和人类偏好模拟任务中的应用。采用音频拼接和上下文学习优化提示工程，并引入多角度集成方法。

Result: AudioJudge在音频特征检测和人类偏好模拟任务中表现优异，Spearman相关系数达0.91。研究发现LAM在噪声下性能稳定，但存在冗长和位置偏差问题。

Conclusion: AudioJudge为语音评估提供了统一且高效的框架，通过多角度集成和提示工程优化显著提升性能，但需进一步解决模型偏差问题。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

### [7] [FLEXITOKENS: Flexible Tokenization for Evolving Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12720)
*Abraham Toluase Owodunni,Orevaoghene Ahia,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出FLEXITOKENS方法，通过可学习的字节级分词器解决语言模型适应新数据分布时的分词效率问题，显著减少分词碎片化并提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型的子词分词器在适应新数据分布时表现僵化，导致分词效率低下，尤其是对未见过的语言或脚本。

Method: 开发了字节级语言模型，引入可学习的分词器，通过预测输入字节序列的边界实现自适应分词，并提出FLEXITOKENS训练目标以增强灵活性。

Result: 在多语言基准测试、形态多样性任务和不同领域中，FLEXITOKENS显著减少分词碎片化，下游任务性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS通过自适应分词器解决了传统分词器的僵化问题，显著提升了语言模型在新数据分布下的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at
https://github.com/owos/flexitokens

### [8] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia是一个基于提示的翻译评估和排名系统，通过推理进行细粒度评估，表现优于现有技术，并与人类评分高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够提供细粒度翻译评估和排名的系统，以改进现有翻译评估方法。

Method: 使用多维质量指标子集，结合Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Qwen-2-72B-Instruct等LLM进行推理评估。

Result: 在英日翻译及WMT多语言任务中表现优于MT-Ranker，评分与人类评分高度相关。

Conclusion: TransEvalnia是一个有效的翻译评估工具，但需解决位置偏差问题。

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

*Fuya Nakamori,Yin Jou Huang,Fei Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于玩家态度和对话上下文切换策略的狼人杀智能体改进方法，验证了其优于固定或隐式策略的基线智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有狼人杀智能体通过提示工程隐式定义策略，无法适应动态变化，需改进为显式策略选择。

Method: 根据游戏上下文和玩家角色估计显式选择策略，并与隐式或固定策略的基线智能体对比。

Result: 验证了所提方法在性能上优于基线智能体。

Conclusion: 显式策略选择方法能有效提升狼人杀智能体的适应性和性能。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种解码时方法，通过小模型引导大模型进行长链推理，无需额外训练。ThinkLogit-DPO进一步优化性能，实验显示性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能在无需额外训练的情况下激发大模型的长链推理能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用小模型引导大模型进行长链推理；进一步提出ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化提升性能。

Result: 在四个数学数据集上，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别相对提升26%和29%的pass@1。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit是一种高效的方法，能以最小或无需额外训练的方式激发大模型的长链推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

TL;DR: Synergy是一种语言模型，通过学习路由机制桥接不同抽象层次，在字节级别训练，性能优于BBPE分词器，且与Llama3相比表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需分词器的架构，实现更灵活和鲁棒的语言模型。

Method: 使用字节级语言模型训练，通过学习路由机制实现不同抽象层次的桥接。

Result: Synergy在相同模型规模和训练数据量下优于Llama3，且中间部分在去除位置编码后表现更好。

Conclusion: Synergy展示了无分词器架构的可行性，为更灵活的模型设计铺平道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过从大型语言模型蒸馏数据来增强文本编码器对否定和模糊表达的鲁棒性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归大型语言模型快速发展，小型文本编码器在需要丰富上下文表示的任务中仍很重要，但现有方法未能很好地捕捉否定语义，影响下游应用。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成多样化的否定和模糊表达数据，采用对比学习策略微调BERT模型。

Result: 显著提升了否定理解能力，同时在通用基准上保持竞争力，方法还可适配大型语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了文本编码器对否定的鲁棒性，且具有通用性。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在符号音乐领域的表现，尤其是它们如何通过文本描述生成音乐数据。

Method: 生成LLM生成的MIDI数据集，训练神经网络进行流派风格分类和旋律补全任务，并与现有模型对比。

Result: LLMs能推断基本音乐结构和时间关系，但缺乏明确音乐背景限制了其表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号音乐生成中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以克服其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估跨语言一致性对模型知识事实性和性能对等性的重要性，并分析其影响因素。

Method: 通过代码混合共指陈述分析跨语言知识一致性，使用可解释性方法研究模型行为。

Result: 多语言模型一致性水平不一，代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐策略效果最佳。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对提升多语言性能和一致性至关重要。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Result: 实验验证了中间层可以生成有意义的内容，分层解码器在多项任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究表明分层解码器具有潜力，未来可能实现从头预训练的通用分层推理器。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决西班牙语表格问答任务（PRESTA）的挑战，提升问答系统的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用多步骤流程：分析表格内容、选择有用列、生成自然语言指令、转换为代码并执行，结合开源LLM和优化提示。

Result: 在任务中取得了85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过LLM生成代码处理表格数据是有效的，未来可进一步优化提示和模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的形式化模型，用于描述攻击场景及其上下文，并展示了其在攻击分析和自动生成攻击脚本中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织面临不断变化的威胁环境，需要自动化网络安全流程，但自动化需要输入数据的规范化。本文旨在满足这一需求。

Method: 通过UML类模型抽象化攻击场景和上下文，构建形式化模型。

Result: 模型成功应用于攻击分析和自动生成攻击脚本，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该形式化模型为网络安全自动化提供了实用工具，支持攻击模拟和培训。

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarriess*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE是一种无监督学习方法，用于学习科学文本的语义嵌入，通过对比学习和LLM生成的摘要训练模型，优于传统基于引用的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法未能准确反映语义相似性，因此需要一种能捕捉文本真实语义内容的新方法。

Method: 利用对比学习和LLM生成的科学摘要训练模型，使语义相关的摘要在嵌入空间中更接近。

Result: 在科学文本嵌入的基准测试中表现优异，实现了同类模型中的最优性能。

Conclusion: SemCSE通过语义聚焦的训练方法，显著提升了科学文本嵌入的语义分离能力。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

TL;DR: 该博士提案计划开发一个计算框架，用于识别文本中的自我方面。自我是一个多面性概念，反映在语言中，但在自然语言处理（NLP）中尚未充分探索。提案将构建自我方面的本体和标注数据集，并评估多种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我是一个多面性概念，在心理学等领域有研究，但在NLP中尚未系统探索。其与心理健康等现象相关，需要NLP分析。

Method: 构建自我方面的本体和标注数据集，开发并评估判别模型、生成模型和嵌入检索方法。

Result: 模型将根据可解释性、真实性、准确性和计算效率进行评估，并在心理健康和现象学案例中应用。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了NLP中自我方面分析的空白，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了标注者人口特征对标注决策的影响，发现文本内容是主要因素，而人口特征影响较小。同时评估了生成式AI作为标注者的可靠性，发现简单的人口特征提示效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解标注变异的来源对开发公平的NLP系统至关重要，尤其是在性别歧视检测等任务中。

Method: 使用广义线性混合模型量化人口特征对标注的影响，并评估生成式AI模型的标注可靠性。

Result: 人口特征仅占8%的变异，文本内容是主导因素；生成式AI的简单人口特征提示未能提升性能。

Conclusion: 应关注内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议，而非人口特征模拟，以实现公平性。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Motivation: 探讨口语叙事能力对后期读写发展的预测作用，并识别需要干预的儿童的语言特征。

Method: 使用简单机器学习方法分析4-5岁儿童的录音故事，比较阿非利卡语和科萨语的数据。

Result: 词汇多样性和句子长度是典型发展的指标，特定动词和助动词的使用与干预需求减少相关，但发音速率信息较少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言特异性和共享的叙事能力预测因素，对多语言环境下的早期评估有重要意义。

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS框架通过图模型分析多智能体协作过程，提出IDS和UPR指标，揭示仅关注最终结果的评估不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终结果，忽略了低效通信和协调导致的冗余推理和计算成本。

Method: 引入GEMMAS框架，建模智能体交互为有向无环图，提出IDS和UPR指标。

Result: 在GSM8K等基准测试中，准确率相近的系统在IDS和UPR上差异显著。

Conclusion: 过程级指标对设计高效协作AI系统至关重要，仅结果评估不足。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Motivation: 早期儿童叙事和理解能力对后期识字能力至关重要，但教师在大型学前班中难以准确识别需要干预的学生。

Method: 系统结合自动语音识别和机器学习评分模型，比较线性模型和LLM的预测能力。

Result: LLM在多数情况下优于线性模型，且与人类专家在识别需要干预的儿童方面表现相当。

Conclusion: 为课堂自动口语评估奠定了基础，帮助教师更专注于个性化学习支持。

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAST的新框架，通过操纵大型语言模型的内部激活状态，实现跨任务知识迁移，无需参数更新或输入扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数据稀缺场景下对未见任务的适应性不足，现有跨任务上下文学习方法在鲁棒性、可扩展性和效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过分析LLMs潜在空间中的激活模式，提出CAST框架，利用高资源任务的样本激活状态来适应低资源任务。

Result: 实验表明，CAST在跨领域和跨语言迁移任务中优于基线方法，具有更高的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST框架为跨任务知识迁移提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注英语推理能力，而印地语等印度语言的模型推理能力尚未充分研究，限制了模型跨语言泛化能力的理解。

Method: 构建了包含405道选择题的HATS数据集，采用多种提示策略评估模型，并提出基于认知理论的Chain of Thought方法。

Result: 实验表明，模型在英语提示下表现最佳，提出的Chain of Thought方法显著提升了印地语类比问题的解决能力。

Conclusion: HATS填补了印地语推理评估资源的空白，为多语言模型的泛化能力研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSteer是一种模块化、自适应的推理时干预技术，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性，无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但也面临对抗性多模态输入的安全风险。

Method: AutoSteer包含三个核心组件：安全感知分数（SAS）、自适应安全探测器（adaptive safety prober）和轻量级拒绝头（Refusal Head）。

Result: 实验表明，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持模型的一般能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer是一种实用、可解释且有效的框架，可提升多模态AI系统的安全性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在训练大型语言推理模型中起关键作用，但其在多步推理（尤其是难题）上的有效性受到质疑。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出QuestA策略，通过在训练中引入部分解决方案来降低问题难度并提供更有信息量的学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，QuestA显著提升了pass@1和pass@k性能，特别是在标准RL表现不佳的问题上，并在多个数学基准测试中达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: QuestA不仅提升了推理能力，还提高了样本效率，为通过RL扩展推理能力提供了一条实用且可推广的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Motivation: 解决人力资源管理中语言技术缺乏公开数据和基准的问题，促进公平和可靠的模型开发。

Method: 通过构建真实、匿名且手动标注的语料库，设计多语言和跨语言任务，并评估性别偏见。

Result: 吸引了76个团队参与，结果显示训练策略比模型规模更重要。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF为劳动市场提供了首个公开基准，推动了稳健、公平和可迁移的语言技术发展。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Result: RCPS在所有质量维度上显著优于基线方法，PREVAL与人类评估高度相关。

Conclusion: RCPS和PREVAL为自动化生成和评估高质量演示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

Result: LLMs在消融研究设计上与人类专家差距显著，自动评估方法不可靠。AbGen-Eval揭示了LLM-as-Judge系统的局限性。

Conclusion: AbGen和AbGen-Eval为未来开发更可靠的LLM评估系统提供了基础，尤其是在复杂科学任务中。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Method: 创建HapticCap数据集，提出触觉字幕检索任务，采用监督对比学习框架结合T5和AST模型。

Result: T5和AST模型组合在触觉字幕检索任务中表现最佳，尤其在分类训练时效果更优。

Conclusion: HapticCap数据集和提出的任务为触觉信号与文本描述的匹配提供了新方向，模型组合展示了潜力。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

Result: 搜索引擎优先排序内容反映偏见，用户意识形态查询加剧偏见，不同引擎优先来源差异显著。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎通过强化意识形态分歧塑造公众认知，加剧信息极化。

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

TL;DR: VL训练对语言模型的词汇概念知识部署有改进，但对分类知识本身影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言（VL）训练是否显著改变语言模型的词汇概念知识，尤其是其分类组织。

Method: 比较纯文本语言模型和VL训练模型的性能，分析其在分类问题上的表现。

Result: VL模型在需要分类理解的纯文本任务中表现更好，但分类知识本身无显著变化。

Conclusion: VL训练改进分类知识的任务部署能力，而非知识本身。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

TL;DR: 本文提出TAIL方法，通过模仿图灵机执行过程生成合成数据，提升LLM的长度泛化能力，并在多任务实验中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer-based LLM在长度泛化上的核心挑战，探索更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出TAIL方法，通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的CoT数据，线性扩展推理步骤。

Result: TAIL显著提升Qwen2.5-7B的长度泛化能力和任务性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 图灵机的关键概念对TAIL的长度泛化至关重要，为LLM推理学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Result: 发现模型在理解上下文方面表现优异，但在生成复杂长文本方面存在明显局限。

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决生成能力的局限性，为上下文感知AI提供统一框架。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究集中于简单双关笑话，忽略了更复杂的幽默形式。

Method: 构建包含600个笑话的数据集，涵盖4种类型，并手动编写高质量解释，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试的模型（包括推理模型）均无法可靠生成所有笑话类型的充分解释。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算幽默领域对简单笑话形式的过度关注，以及LLMs在解释复杂幽默时的局限性。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Conclusion: XRL领域需要进一步研究，以满足对强化学习行为解释的需求，并推动相关技术的发展。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Result: 实验表明，LMM能基于RL代理的行为轨迹迭代优化游戏机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助游戏设计提供了实用且可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

Result: 现有欺骗探针的黑盒到白盒性能提升较弱，但结果令人鼓舞。

Conclusion: 欺骗探针在检测AI助手欺骗行为方面有一定潜力，但需进一步改进。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将概率事件演算（PEC）转化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以支持目标导向推理，同时保持PEC的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC在不确定环境中具有优势，但缺乏目标导向推理机制，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将PEC领域形式化转化为MDP，引入“动作执行情境”概念，保留PEC的灵活动作语义。

Result: PEC-MDP形式化支持时间推理和目标驱动规划，并能将学习到的策略映射回人类可读的PEC表示。

Conclusion: PEC-MDP扩展了PEC的能力，同时保持了其可解释性，为算法和理论工具的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Motivation: 随着对可信AI的需求增加，开发针对MILP的对比解释技术变得重要。

Method: 将用户查询编码为额外约束，通过计算不可约不可行子系统（IIS）生成解释，并以“原因图”形式呈现。

Result: 在经典优化问题上测试，验证了方法的可行性和计算难度。

Conclusion: X-MILP提供了一种有效的解释框架，帮助用户理解MILP解决方案的原因。

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态强化学习框架，改进树状推理方法，解决静态树结构的局限性和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型在复杂问题推理中存在错误传播和知识整合困难，静态树状推理方法（如ProbTree）虽能缓解这些问题，但存在动态适应性和计算效率不足的局限性。

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，实时构建推理树，基于置信度估计选择最优策略（分解、检索或聚合），提升灵活性和效率。

Result: 该方法在保持概率严谨性的同时，提高了解决方案的质量和计算效率，实现了动态适应和资源优化。

Conclusion: 研究为树状推理提供了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和现实问答系统所需的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的随机输出和不透明内部状态，传统道德评估标准已不适用，需修订以适应新技术。

Method: 提出十项功能标准（如道德一致性、上下文敏感性等），并通过模拟道德代理（SMA-LLS）和自动驾驶公交车（APB）场景验证其适用性。

Result: 新标准为LLM道德代理提供了实用评估框架，促进其与社会更佳整合。

Conclusion: 修订后的标准有助于提升LLM道德代理的实用性和社会接受度。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及抽象函数和谓词的决策任务中，精确匹配往往罕见或不必要，因此需要高效的高阶模糊推理方法。

Method: 采用高阶模式和基于最小T-范数的模糊等价关系，提出了一种统一算法，并证明了其终止性、可靠性和完备性。

Result: 算法能够计算最高近似度的最一般统一子，且该问题与经典问题一样是单一的。

Conclusion: 该方法为高阶模糊推理提供了一种高效且理论完备的解决方案。

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEA的评估方法，将模型能耗信息纳入评估过程，初步结果显示用户倾向于选择更节能的小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大型语言模型的方法存在局限性，如自动化基准与人类评价相关性低，而传统人类评价方法又难以扩展。同时，模型能耗问题日益重要，需研究能耗意识如何影响用户选择。

Method: 提出GEA（Generative Energy Arena），在公共竞技场中结合模型能耗信息，让用户评估并排名模型。

Result: 初步结果显示，用户了解能耗信息后，更倾向于选择小型且节能的模型。

Conclusion: 对于多数用户交互，高性能模型的额外成本和能耗并未带来感知质量的显著提升，节能模型更受青睐。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Method: 构建FormulaOne基准测试，结合图论、逻辑和算法，生成高难度问题，并设计配套的简单任务集FormulaOne-Warmup。

Result: 前沿模型如OpenAI的o3在FormulaOne上表现极差，解决率低于1%。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在专家级理解上仍有巨大差距，FormulaOne为未来研究提供了评估框架。

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate
continued research, we release our model publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习过度依赖大规模并行化，但忽略了数学推理、物理仿真、序列决策等问题本质上需要串行计算步骤，现有并行架构在处理这类任务时存在根本性局限

Method: 从复杂性理论角度形式化区分串行与并行计算问题，分析当前以并行为中心的架构在处理本质串行任务时的局限性

Result: 证明了某些计算任务（如数学推理、物理仿真、序列决策）具有不可并行化的串行依赖特性，当前并行架构在这些任务上面临根本性限制

Conclusion: 认识到计算的串行本质对机器学习、模型设计和硬件开发具有深远影响，随着AI处理越来越复杂的推理任务，有意识地扩展串行计算能力（而非仅仅并行计算）对持续进步至关重要

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

Motivation: 现有AI模型虽然能与人类交互并提供满意回应，但缺乏自主行动和独立推理能力，且通常需要显式查询作为输入。AI智能体在跨领域知识整合方面存在困难，不如人类。心理意象在大脑思维过程中起基础作用，能基于内部多感官数据、计划行动、需求和推理能力执行任务，因此需要研究如何将心理意象整合到机器思维框架中。

Result: 作者对该框架进行了验证测试，并在论文中展示和讨论了测试结果。但摘要中未详细说明具体的实验结果和性能指标。

Conclusion: 通过将心理意象整合到机器思维框架中，可以启动和促进思维过程，有助于解决现有AI模型在自主推理和跨域知识整合方面的局限性。该框架为构建更具自主性和推理能力的AI系统提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据流中的概念漂移给机器学习带来挑战，现有的动态选择(DS)方法虽然在漂移场景下表现良好，但需要针对概念漂移进行适配，特别是训练策略需要创建局部专家，而传统的邻域搜索DS方法在数据持续到达时可能变得不可行。

Method: 提出IncA-DES框架，采用促进局部专家生成的训练策略，假设特征空间的不同区域随时间变得可用；融合概念漂移检测器来维护信息并适应新概念；使用基于重叠的分类过滤器避免在邻域达成共识时使用DS方法；提出在线K-d树算法快速移除实例并处理数据流中的不平衡问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，与七种最先进方法相比，所提框架在不同标签可用性水平下获得了最佳平均准确率，并在最准确方法中表现出最小的处理时间。在线K-d树的融合在精度损失可忽略的情况下改善了处理时间。

Conclusion: IncA-DES框架成功解决了数据流概念漂移问题，通过训练策略优化、概念漂移检测和在线K-d树算法的结合，实现了高精度和高效率的平衡，为数据流中的动态选择方法提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

### [63] [Second-Order Bounds for [0,1]-Valued Regression via Betting Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12584)
*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了[0,1]值回归问题，提出了一种新的损失函数（betting loss），实现了无需先验知识的方差自适应边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在[0,1]值回归问题中，是否存在一种损失函数能够实现优于对数损失的方差依赖边界。

Method: 提出了一种名为betting loss的新损失函数，并分析了其性能。

Result: 证明了betting loss能够实现方差自适应边界，且无需先验知识。

Conclusion: betting loss在[0,1]值回归问题中表现优越，实现了无需先验知识的方差自适应边界。

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种针对元任务（贝叶斯超参数优化的热启动）的表格表示学习方法，通过深度度量学习和地标重建，评估表明方法虽能学习与地标对齐的表示，但对元任务性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构表格数据集的表示学习在元学习中仍是一个开放问题，现有方法多为通用表示，本文针对特定元任务提出定制化方法。

Method: 提出两种方法：深度度量学习和地标重建，旨在捕捉地标特性，并通过目标元任务和地标对齐度评估。

Result: 实验显示，提出的编码器能有效学习与地标对齐的表示，但对超参数优化热启动的性能提升不明显。

Conclusion: 定制化表示学习方法虽能捕捉地标特性，但需进一步优化以显著提升元任务性能。

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM微调中任务数据集混合比例的选择依赖手动和启发式方法，缺乏理论支持，TASKPGM旨在提供一种原则性和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: TASKPGM利用行为差异（如Jensen Shannon Divergence和Pointwise Mutual Information）建模任务关系，通过MRF最小化能量函数，在单纯形约束下获得闭式解。

Result: 在Llama 2和Mistral模型上，TASKPGM在MMLU和BIGBench等评估中表现优于传统方法，同时提供任务影响和混合组成的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: TASKPGM为LLM微调提供了一种高效、鲁棒且可解释的任务混合优化方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）训练中的启动开销问题，提出了优化框架Bootseer，成功减少了50%的启动开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在工业规模中的广泛应用，启动开销成为影响效率的关键问题，尤其是在多团队迭代调试的场景中。

Method: 通过分析真实生产数据，识别启动开销的主要瓶颈，并设计Bootseer框架，采用热块记录预取、依赖快照和HDFS-FUSE分条技术进行优化。

Result: Bootseer在实际生产环境中部署后，启动开销减少了50%。

Conclusion: 启动开销是LLM训练中的重要问题，Bootseer通过系统级优化显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

Motivation: 探索推理微调模型中回溯行为的机制，理解其是否依赖于基础模型的已有表征。

Method: 通过识别基础模型中的特定方向，并验证其在蒸馏推理模型中诱导回溯行为的效果。

Result: 发现基础模型中的一个方向能系统性诱导蒸馏模型中的回溯行为，且该行为无法通过词级属性简单解释。

Conclusion: 推理微调模型通过重新利用基础模型的已有表征形成新行为回路，而非从头学习新能力。

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

Motivation: 神经信号包含敏感信息，数据共享存在隐私问题，联邦学习作为一种隐私保护框架，有望解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于FL的神经解码方法，并在开放和闭环场景下系统评估其性能和隐私。

Result: 开放环中FL表现优于本地学习，但闭环中需调整FL方法，本地学习性能更优但隐私风险更高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实时自适应应用中性能与隐私的权衡，需设计专门针对单用户应用的FL方法。

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

Motivation: 尽管PINNs在结合物理原理和数据驱动建模方面表现出色，但其外推性能较差且对激活函数选择敏感。

Method: 采用迁移学习在扩展训练域中使用少量选定的配点，并提出自适应激活函数以提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在外推域中平均减少40%的相对L2误差和50%的平均绝对误差，且计算成本未显著增加。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了PINNs的外推能力，为复杂科学和工程问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解深度学习为何有效提供了理论基础，解释了训练中观察到的谱结构。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Conclusion: LySep模型有效解决了深度学习优化问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公共多模态数据集上优于单模态和多模态基线。

Conclusion: 该框架在BCI应用中具有潜力，能有效提升EEG模型性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测面临非平稳性、多尺度周期性和瞬态动态等挑战，现有方法如Transformer和Mamba在效率和效果上存在局限。

Method: FLDmamba利用傅里叶和拉普拉斯变换的优势，有效捕捉时间序列的多尺度周期性和瞬态动态，并增强对数据噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，FLDmamba在时间序列预测任务中表现优于基于Transformer和其他Mamba的架构。

Conclusion: FLDmamba为时间序列预测提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码和数据已公开以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于并行多知识学习的无损压缩器PMKLC，解决了现有学习型压缩器在压缩比、吞吐量和鲁棒性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型压缩器在压缩比、吞吐量和鲁棒性方面表现不足，限制了其在大规模基因组数据库中的应用。

Method: 1）提出自动化多知识学习框架；2）设计GPU加速的(s,k)-mer编码器；3）引入数据块分区和逐步模型传递机制；4）设计单GPU和多GPU两种压缩模式。

Result: PMKLC在15个真实数据集上测试，压缩比平均提升73.6%，吞吐量提升3-10倍，且鲁棒性和内存成本表现优异。

Conclusion: PMKLC在压缩性能、吞吐量和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合降阶模型（ROM）和神经算子学习的新框架RONOM，用于解决偏微分方程的计算问题，并在输入泛化、空间超分辨率和离散化鲁棒性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统降阶模型（ROM）在变网格灵活性上的限制，以及神经算子学习在无限维与离散化算子误差量化上的不足。

Method: 提出RONOM框架，结合ROM和神经算子学习，建立离散化误差界，并通过数值实验验证其性能。

Result: RONOM在输入泛化、空间超分辨率和离散化鲁棒性上优于现有神经算子，并在时间超分辨率场景中提供新见解。

Conclusion: RONOM框架成功结合了ROM和神经算子学习的优势，为偏微分方程的高效计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

Motivation: 离线强化学习需要显式奖励标注，成本高且难以获取。ReLOAD旨在通过专家演示生成内在奖励信号。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优异，与传统奖励标注方法竞争。

Conclusion: ReLOAD为离线强化学习提供了一种无需人工奖励标注的有效方法。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

Result: 较大学习率导致NTK特征向量与训练目标更对齐。

Conclusion: 研究增强了对深度学习梯度下降训练动态的理解。

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布接近性测试方法NAMMD，通过结合RKHS范数调整MMD值，解决了传统MMD在多分布对评估中的不足，并在理论和实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布接近性测试方法主要针对离散一维空间，难以处理复杂数据（如图像）。MMD虽能衡量复杂分布差异，但在多分布对评估中信息不足。

Method: 提出NAMMD，通过RKHS范数调整MMD值，设计基于NAMMD的分布接近性测试方法。

Result: 理论证明NAMMD测试比MMD测试具有更高的检验力，且类型I误差可控。实验验证了其在多种数据上的有效性。

Conclusion: NAMMD为复杂数据的分布接近性测试提供了更优解决方案，并在两样本测试中同样表现出色。

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: 证明了CSI扰动在编码生物特征方面的潜力，验证了低成本Wi-Fi硬件在无设备被动识别中的可行性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

Result: iw-SFT在语言模型和连续控制任务中表现优异，例如在AIME 2024数据集上达到66.7%。

Conclusion: iw-SFT是一种简单有效的改进方法，性能接近更复杂的RL算法。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，机器学习预测器的解释质量影响用户信任和决策，但现有解释可能难以理解或不可信。

Method: 引入ULER（用户为中心的低质量解释拒绝器），通过学习人类评分和特征相关性判断来评估解释质量。

Result: ULER在多个分类和回归基准测试中优于现有方法，并在新的人类标注数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: ULER能有效识别和拒绝低质量解释，提升用户对预测器的信任和决策质量。

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务中的工作负载预测对自动扩展和调度至关重要，但现有Transformer模型在计算效率上无法满足大规模需求。

Method: Fremer通过频域处理复杂周期性模式，满足高效、准确和鲁棒性需求。

Result: Fremer在多个指标上优于SOTA模型，并在实际应用中显著降低延迟和资源消耗。

Conclusion: Fremer在云服务工作负载预测中表现出卓越性能和实用性。

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

Result: 实验表明，这种不确定性感知方法提高了传统机器学习和深度学习场景中解释的鲁棒性和可达性。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化与解耦框架为模型预测提供了新的解释维度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

TL;DR: ARES是一种新的概率框架，通过仅基于已验证的前提判断每个主张，有效防止错误传播，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成的推理链中，初始错误会传播并削弱最终结论的可靠性，现有方法难以检测此类传播错误。

Method: 提出Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES)，一种基于概率的框架，通过仅依赖已验证的前提判断每个主张，避免错误传播。

Result: ARES在四个基准测试中达到72.1%的Macro-F1（提升8.2点），在长推理链中表现尤为突出（90.3% F1，提升27.6点）。

Conclusion: ARES通过统计保证和细粒度评分，显著提升了错误传播检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在重复应用层操作时会出现过平滑问题，即图信号收敛于图拉普拉斯算子的低频分量。本文旨在通过改进MRGNN中的储层定义来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于Fairing算法的MRGNN变体，该算法通过拉普拉斯算子实现了一种无收缩的带通谱滤波，适用于图分类等任务。

Result: 理论分析表明，调整谱系数可以调节冗余随机游走的贡献。初步实验验证了该方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为控制图信号平滑提供了新思路，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

Result: 在铁路轨道刚度估计的案例中，模型显著优于现有方法，实现了高分辨率的健康评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化、高精度的基础设施健康监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Conclusion: FedGA有效解决了联邦学习中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

Result: 在AnthroProtect数据集上，CFR对灌木丛、森林和湿地赋予更高相关性，且随不确定性增加，解释性下降。

Conclusion: CFR提供了一种基于确定性的数据中心方法，评估卫星图像中模式对自然性的相关性。

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model

AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious

tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.
The source code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 结合最优架构选择的模型表现优于现有模型，为未来Transformer架构设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a
fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward

*Vittorio Cipriani,Valentino Delle Rose,Luca San Mauro,Giovanni Solda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了基于无限图G的假设类的PAC和在线学习能力，重点关注有限支持置换下的学习性及其与图自同构平凡性的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无限图在置换操作下的学习性，揭示其与图结构和自同构性质的联系。

Method: 分析有限支持置换的PAC学习性，并扩展到在线学习；使用描述性集合论和可计算性理论工具。

Result: 证明了有限支持置换的PAC学习性等价于在线学习性，并基于无限随机图的扩展性质对不可学习图进行了分类。

Conclusion: 无限图的学习性可通过有限置换的性质完全刻画，且与自同构平凡性密切相关。

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

*Pengjin Wu,Ferrante Neri,Zhenhua Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASViT是一种可微分架构搜索方法，专为Vision Transformers设计，解决了传统方法的计算资源消耗大和创新性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NAS方法在ViT架构搜索中面临计算资源需求高、创新性不足的挑战，DASViT旨在填补可微分搜索的空白。

Method: DASViT采用可微分架构搜索技术，专注于ViT架构的微观设计，突破传统Transformer编码器的限制。

Result: 实验表明，DASViT发现的架构在多个数据集上优于ViT-B/16，且参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: DASViT为ViT架构搜索提供了一种高效且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

### [110] [Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13263)
*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于排序算法的核函数框架，用于置换空间中的贝叶斯优化，显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有置换空间的贝叶斯优化方法（如Mallows核）计算复杂度高，需要改进。

Method: 通过排序算法（如归并排序）构建核函数（Merge Kernel），并结合轻量级描述符提升鲁棒性。

Result: Merge Kernel在多个基准测试中优于Mallows核，计算复杂度更低且效果更好。

Conclusion: Merge Kernel为置换空间中的贝叶斯优化提供了更紧凑且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

Method: NGTM将图表示为潜在主题的混合，每个主题定义语义子结构的分布，结合全局结构变量生成图。

Result: NGTM在生成质量上具有竞争力，同时支持细粒度控制和解释性。

Conclusion: NGTM为图生成提供了可解释性和可控性，适用于分子设计等领域。

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表达性语音合成模型受限于开源数据集中非语言声音（NVs）的多样性不足。

Method: 构建NVTTS数据集，结合ASR、NV标记、情感分类和多标注者转录融合算法，优化开源TTS模型。

Result: 在人类评估和自动指标（如说话人相似性和NV保真度）上，优化后的TTS模型与闭源系统性能相当。

Conclusion: NVTTS数据集解决了表达性TTS研究的关键瓶颈，并已开源。

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional
categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive
TTS research. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表示学习方法主要从模型学习角度出发，与强化学习任务不匹配。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种更符合Bellman更新结构的表示学习方法。

Method: 通过发现零IBE条件下的谱关系，提出一种新的理论目标，学习与Bellman动态对齐的状态-动作特征表示，并对现有算法进行简单修改。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够实现结构化探索，提升性能，尤其在困难探索和长时程信用分配任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation为基于值的强化学习提供了一种理论扎实且高效的表示学习方法。

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于单调梯度网络（mGradNets）的方法，用于直接学习最优传输映射，并通过Monge-Ampère方程定义训练损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单调梯度函数在解决最优传输问题中起核心作用，而传统方法难以直接参数化单调梯度映射。

Method: 利用mGradNets直接参数化单调梯度映射空间，并通过最小化Monge-Ampère方程定义的损失函数学习最优传输映射。

Result: 实验表明，mGradNets的结构偏置有助于学习最优传输映射，并成功应用于机器人群体控制问题。

Conclusion: mGradNets为学习最优传输映射提供了有效工具，并在实际应用中展示了潜力。

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INRs）的时间序列缺失值填补方法MoTM，通过混合多个INRs模型和岭回归器，实现了在域内和域外的鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测任务，而跨域缺失值填补任务研究不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MoTM方法，结合多个独立训练的INRs模型和一个岭回归器，适应不同时间序列模式和缺失场景。

Result: MoTM在多种缺失场景（如块缺失、点缺失、变采样率）下表现出鲁棒的域内和域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoTM为适应性时间序列填补基础模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短期电价预测对电力市场竞价策略至关重要，但现有数据驱动方法依赖输入数据质量。本文探讨异步电价数据是否能提升预测准确性。

Method: 采用先进模型集成方法，利用德国-卢森堡、奥地利和瑞士等市场的异步电价数据，对比利时和瑞典市场进行预测。

Result: 在比利时和瑞典市场分别实现了22%和9%的预测精度提升，且在极端市场条件下同样有效。

Conclusion: 异步电价数据可显著提升预测精度，但需频繁模型校准且计算成本高；更多市场数据未必带来更好效果。研究为欧洲电力市场参与者提供了优化策略的指导。

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

Motivation: 现有方法无法满足同时建模团队动态和关系的需求，且缺乏可解释性和多任务预测能力。

Method: TRENN结合了自动时态图提取器、时态关系编码器、团队构念预测解码器和两个解释模块；MT-TRENN通过多任务头扩展TRENN。

Result: 实验表明，TRENN和MT-TRENN显著优于仅使用时态或关系信息的方法，并提供可解释的见解。

Conclusion: TRENN和MT-TRENN适用于人本AI应用，如高风险协作环境中的智能决策支持系统。

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

TL;DR: GeoReg模型结合卫星影像和地理空间数据，利用大语言模型（LLM）解决数据稀缺问题，通过特征提取和分类提升社会经济指标估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺地区（如发展中国家）准确估计社会经济指标（如GDP、人口、教育水平）对政策制定和可持续发展至关重要。

Method: 模型整合多源数据，利用LLM提取特征并分类其相关性（正、负、混合或无），结合线性估计和非线性变换，捕捉复杂模式。

Result: 在三个不同发展水平国家的实验中，模型表现优于基线方法，尤其在数据稀缺的低收入国家。

Conclusion: GeoReg模型为数据稀缺地区的社会经济指标估计提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对输入和权重扰动的高度敏感性导致对抗样本脆弱性、训练发散和过拟合等问题，现有Lipschitz约束方法尚未应用于现代架构。

Method: 开发了计算高效的权重矩阵约束工具，结合优化器Muon和权重约束方法，训练Lipschitz约束的Transformer模型。

Result: 在Shakespeare文本上，2-Lipschitz Transformer验证准确率达60%；在145M参数模型中，10-Lipschitz Transformer在互联网文本上达到21%准确率。

Conclusion: Lipschitz约束的Transformer在无需稳定性措施下可训练，但为匹配基线性能，Lipschitz上界需显著放宽。

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Motivation: 解决语音情感识别（SER）中未充分研究的用户群体（青少年和55岁以上成年人）及多语言（丹麦语和英语）问题。

Method: 开发实验范式，结合自定义用户界面和实时SER预测后端，参与者通过表达四种情感目标完成任务。

Result: 结果显示语言和年龄组间无显著差异，模型表现稳健，但高唤醒情感识别存在局限。

Conclusion: 需超越系统为中心的准确性指标，采用更包容、以人为中心的SER模型，揭示情感表达与机器解读间的偏差风险。

Abstract: This study explores how age and language shape the deliberate vocal
expression of emotion, addressing underexplored user groups, Teenagers (N = 12)
and Adults 55+ (N = 12), within speech emotion recognition (SER). While most
SER systems are trained on spontaneous, monolingual English data, our research
evaluates how such models interpret intentionally performed emotional speech
across age groups and languages (Danish and English). To support this, we
developed a novel experimental paradigm combining a custom user interface with
a backend for real-time SER prediction and data logging. Participants were
prompted to hit visual targets in valence-arousal space by deliberately
expressing four emotion targets. While limitations include some reliance on
self-managed voice recordings and inconsistent task execution, the results
suggest contrary to expectations, no significant differences between language
or age groups, and a degree of cross-linguistic and age robustness in model
interpretation. Though some limitations in high-arousal emotion recognition
were evident. Our qualitative findings highlight the need to move beyond
system-centered accuracy metrics and embrace more inclusive, human-centered SER
models. By framing emotional expression as a goal-directed act and logging the
real-time gap between human intent and machine interpretation, we expose the
risks of affective misalignment.

Abstract: Traditional volume visualization (VolVis) methods, like direct volume
rendering, suffer from rigid transfer function designs and high computational
costs. Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency,
they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for
semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an
interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric
scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic
segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic
components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model
architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user
intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and
declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D
editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene
editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system
through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility
and usability in volumetric data exploration. We strongly recommend readers

Abstract: Human-AI interfaces play a crucial role in advancing practices and research
within the healthcare domain. However, designing such interfaces presents a
substantial challenge for designers. In this paper, we propose systematic
guidance for designing human-AI interfaces in typical healthcare scenarios by
summarizing the design patterns for presenting and interacting with common
information entities. To deepen our understanding of these 12 design patterns,
we interviewed 12 healthcare professionals to explore potential usage scenarios
and important considerations. Furthermore, we conducted workshops with 14
participants recruited online to evaluate our design patterns. Finally, we
discussed the generalizability of the design patterns to other application
domains, the limitations, and the future work.

TL;DR: 研究发现，受众年龄影响其对数字媒体的参与度，尤其是在交互式叙事可视化中。年轻群体比年长群体更投入，理解更深。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨受众年龄对交互式叙事可视化参与度的影响，填补设计中对年龄因素忽视的空白。

Method: 通过可视化参与度问卷进行实证实验，比较不同年龄群体的参与度，并进行定性分析。

Result: 年长群体的参与度略低于年轻群体，且对交互式叙事的术语和理解能力较弱。

Conclusion: 建议交互式叙事可视化作者根据受众年龄设计更具包容性的内容。

Abstract: Research has shown that an audiences' age impacts their engagement in digital
media. Interactive narrative visualization is an increasingly popular form of
digital media that combines data visualization and storytelling to convey
important information. However, audience age is often overlooked by interactive
narrative visualization authors. Using an established visualization engagement
questionnaire, we ran an empirical experiment where we compared end-user
engagement to audience age. We found a small difference in engagement scores
where older age cohorts were less engaged than the youngest age cohort. Our
qualitative analysis revealed that the terminology and overall understanding of
interactive narrative patterns integrated into narrative visualization was more
apparent in the feedback from younger age cohorts relative to the older age
cohorts. We conclude this paper with a series of recommendations for authors of
interactive narrative visualization on how to design inclusively for audiences
according to their age.

TL;DR: 研究评估了公众对完全自主网络化身（CAs）在日常生活中的物理支持的看法和社会影响，通过大型演示和调查发现公众对其感兴趣，但对其任务执行可靠性表示担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨完全自主网络化身（CAs）在克服物理限制方面的潜力及其社会接受度。

Method: 在19天的公共活动中进行大规模演示和调查，分析2855名参与者的反馈，重点关注333名与完全自主CAs互动的参与者。

Result: 公众对CAs在日常和工作中的物理支持感兴趣，但对任务执行可靠性表示担忧，而对成本和拟人化互动不太关注。

Conclusion: 完全自主CAs具有潜力，但需解决任务可靠性问题以提高公众接受度。

Abstract: Cybernetic avatars (CAs) are key components of an avatar-symbiotic society,
enabling individuals to overcome physical limitations through virtual agents
and robotic assistants. While semi-autonomous CAs intermittently require human
teleoperation and supervision, the deployment of fully autonomous CAs remains a
challenge. This study evaluates public perception and potential social impacts
of fully autonomous CAs for physical support in daily life. To this end, we
conducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day
public event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside
semi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we
analyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including
a subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and
shared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The
survey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and
at work. However, concerns were raised regarding task execution reliability. In
contrast, cost and human-like interaction were not dominant concerns. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化生成工具的普及降低了图表制作的难度，但缺乏感知理论理解的作者难以评估图表效果，需要一种方法来预测和优化设计。

Method: 通过整合感知理论到视觉特征提取中，开发感知模拟模型，预测观众可能注意到的图形模式，并将其嵌入到原型界面PatternSight中。

Result: 模型能模拟大多数观众的感知行为，覆盖多样化的感知结果；PatternSight有效帮助作者优化图表设计。

Conclusion: 感知模拟模型和PatternSight工具能有效辅助图表作者评估和改进设计，满足数据模式表达需求。

Abstract: The boom in visualization generation tools has significantly lowered the
threshold for chart authoring. Nevertheless, chart authors with an insufficient
understanding of perceptual theories may encounter difficulties in evaluating
the effectiveness of chart representations, thereby struggling to identify the
appropriate chart design to convey the intended data patterns. To address this
issue, we propose a perception simulation model that can assess the perceptual
effectiveness of charts by predicting graphical patterns that chart viewers are
likely to notice. The perception simulation model integrates perceptual theory
into visual feature extraction of chart elements to provide interpretable model
outcomes. Human perceptual results proved that the outcome of our model can
simulate the perceptual grouping behaviors of most chart viewers and cover
diverse perceptual results. We also embed the model into a prototype interface
called PatternSight to facilitate chart authors in assessing whether the chart
design can satisfy their pattern representation requirements as expected and
determining feasible improvements of visual design. According to the results of
a user experiment, PatternSight can effectively assist chart authors in
optimizing chart design for representing data patterns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球人口老龄化，AI代理成为支持老年人护理的工具，但如何确保其与老年人的自主性偏好一致仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 通过跨学科的自主性概念化，分析了老年人自主性的四个关键维度，并提出了三个研究方向。

Result: 提出了决策自主性、目标导向自主性、控制自主性和社会责任自主性四个维度，并指出了未来研究的重点。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注社会责任自主性、任务视角下的代理自主性操作化以及自主性测量工具的开发。

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注患者-机器人或医生-机器人交互，而智能虚拟超声医师在医生-机器人-患者沟通中的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过结合LLM驱动的对话、语音转文本、文本转语音和机器人控制技术，开发了一个XR中的虚拟代理，实现实时交互。

Result: 系统提高了机器人超声采集的效率、清晰度和可访问性，增强了医生-机器人交互的控制和信任，同时改善了患者体验。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解IVS如何桥接医生-机器人-患者交互中的沟通缺口提供了初步探索，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The advancement and maturity of large language models (LLMs) and robotics
have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in
the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on
either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent
virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication
remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in
Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between
physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent
communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic
explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the
RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to
the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,
clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work
constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication
gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and
therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient
experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解名人如何构建被深度伪造技术（deepfake）侵害的经历，以及她们在寻求救济时遇到的障碍。

Method: 采用批判性话语心理分析方法，分析八位名人女性和一位非二元性别个体的公开声明，运用Baumer的“Usee”概念（非自愿、不知情且直接受技术影响的利益相关者）。

Result: 名人描述了被非自愿侵害的伤害和发现这些视频的痛苦，同时指出了阻碍救济的基础设施和社会因素（如指责、沉默叙事和深度伪造滥用行业）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了利益相关者在深度伪造滥用基础设施中的作用，并提出了人机交互改善NSII救济的潜力。未来工作应挑战推动NSII创作和传播的错误信念。

Abstract: Deepfake technology is often used to create non-consensual synthetic intimate
imagery (NSII), mainly of celebrity women. Through Critical Discursive
Psychological analysis we ask; i) how celebrities construct being targeted by
deepfakes and ii) how they navigate infrastructural and social obstacles when
seeking recourse. In this paper, we adopt Baumers concept of Usees
(stakeholders who are non-consenting, unaware and directly targeted by
technology), to understand public statements made by eight celebrity women and
one non-binary individual targeted with NSII. Celebrities describe harms of
being non-consensually targeted by deepfakes and the distress of becoming aware
of these videos. They describe various infrastructural/social factors (e.g.
blaming/ silencing narratives and the industry behind deepfake abuse) which
hinder activism and recourse. This work has implications in recognizing the
roles of various stakeholders in the infrastructures underlying deepfake abuse
and the potential of human-computer interaction to improve existing recourses
for NSII. We also contribute to understanding how false beliefs online
facilitate deepfake abuse. Future work should involve interventions which
challenge the values and false beliefs which motivate NSII
creation/dissemination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与物理对象的关系，以提升TUI设计的成功率和用户体验。

Method: 通过分析人类与物体的空间互动，提炼观察结果并转化为设计启发式，应用于现有空间TUI的评估。

Result: 提出了一套空间性启发式方法，并定义了空间TUI的概念。

Conclusion: 空间性是TUI设计成功的关键，启发式方法有助于优化TUI应用。

Abstract: Like the prehistoric twig and stone, tangible user interfaces (TUIs) are
objects manipulated by humans. TUI success will depend on how well they exploit
spatiality, the intuitive spatial skills humans have with the objects they use.
In this paper we carefully examine the relationship between humans and physical
objects, and related previous research. From this examination we distill a set
of observations, and turn these into heuristics for incorporation of spatiality
into TUI application design, a cornerstone for their success. Following this
line of thought, we identify spatial TUIs, the subset of TUIs that mediate
interaction with shape, space and structure. We then examine several existing
spatial TUIs using our heuristics.

Motivation: 传统认知负荷测量依赖主观自我报告，研究者希望找到更客观的替代方法。

Method: 利用项目反应理论（IRT）计算题目难度参数，分析其与认知负荷理论的关系。

Result: 题目难度参数与内在和外在认知负荷理论一致，可作为内在负荷的代理指标。

Conclusion: 题目难度参数可用于学习游戏中认知负荷建模，提供更客观的测量方法。

Abstract: Cognitive load is key to ensuring an optimal learning experience. However,
measuring the cognitive load of educational tasks typically relies on
self-report measures which has been criticized by researchers for being
subjective. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using item
difficulty parameters as a proxy for measuring cognitive load in an online
learning platform. Difficulty values that were derived using item-response
theory were consistent with theories of how intrinsic and extraneous load
contribute to cognitive load. This finding suggests that we can use item
difficulty to represent intrinsic load when modelling cognitive load in
learning games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市化导致熟悉的环境消失，传统回忆活动缺乏有效的视觉和听觉线索。

Conclusion: 提出了设计建议，以使AI辅助的VR回忆活动对老年人更具可访问性和吸引力。

Abstract: Reminiscence activities, which involve recalling and sharing past
experiences, have proven beneficial for improving cognitive function, mood, and
overall well-being. However, urbanization has led to the disappearance of
familiar environments, removing visual and audio cues for effective
reminiscence. While old photos can serve as visual cues to aid reminiscence, it
is challenging for people to reconstruct the reminisced content and environment
that are not in the photos. Virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence
(AI) offer the ability to reconstruct an immersive environment with dynamic
content and to converse with people to help them gradually reminisce. We
designed RemVerse, an AI-empowered VR prototype aimed to support reminiscence
activities. Integrating generative models and AI agent into a VR environment,
RemVerse helps older adults reminisce with AI-generated visual cues and
interactive dialogues. Our user study with 14 older adults showed that RemVerse
effectively supported reminiscence activities by triggering, concretizing, and
deepening personal memories, while fostering increased engagement and autonomy
among older adults. Based on our findings, we proposed design implications to
make reminiscence activities in AI-assisted VR more accessible and engaging for
older adults.

TL;DR: FocusView是一个为ADHD用户设计的视频定制界面，显著减少分心，提升视频观看体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADHD患者在观看信息视频时因动态多模态元素易分心，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 设计FocusView界面，允许ADHD用户多维度定制视频，并通过12名ADHD参与者评估效果。

Result: FocusView显著减少分心，揭示用户对分心元素的多样化感知及定制偏好。

Conclusion: 研究为ADHD社区的视频定制系统提供了设计考量，如减少选项以避免定制本身的分心。

Abstract: While videos have become increasingly prevalent in delivering information
across different educational and professional contexts, individuals with ADHD
often face attention challenges when watching informational videos due to the
dynamic, multimodal, yet potentially distracting video elements. To understand
and address this critical challenge, we designed \textit{FocusView}, a video
customization interface that allows viewers with ADHD to customize
informational videos from different aspects. We evaluated FocusView with 12
participants with ADHD and found that FocusView significantly improved the
viewability of videos by reducing distractions. Through the study, we uncovered
participants' diverse perceptions of video distractions (e.g., background music
as a distraction vs. stimulation boost) and their customization preferences,
highlighting unique ADHD-relevant needs in designing video customization
interfaces (e.g., reducing the number of options to avoid distraction caused by
customization itself). We further derived design considerations for future
video customization systems for the ADHD community.
