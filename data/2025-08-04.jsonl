We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations.

To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal.

Inverse Relationship Between Comprehension and Trust in Explainability Visualizations of Biased ML Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Systems relying on ML have become ubiquitous, but so has biased behavior\nwithin them. Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders' trust\nin systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different\nbackgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models'\nbehavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey\nexplainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics.\nWe conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools\n(LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how\ntaxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for\nnon-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between\ncomprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they\ntrust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is\nstrongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations\nincrease people's perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces\ntrust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability\nvisualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show\nthat visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension,\nincrease perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model\nbias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design,\nsignificantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work\nadvances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically\ninvestigates visualization's role in facilitating responsible ML applications."}

To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX.

Simulating HAT is challenging due to\nthe need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,\nneither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.\nMachine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy\nsurfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to\ngeneralize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions\nin proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.\nHere, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large\ndatasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural\nnetwork architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT\nPESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE\nconsistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,\nachieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT\nbarrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into\nlarge-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted\nbarriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in\npeptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance\ntrade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials\nwith transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is\ngeneralizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate\nsimulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments."}

Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts.

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns.
