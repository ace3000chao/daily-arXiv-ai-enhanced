While these\nsystems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and\ncreativity - they present a fundamental \"comfort-growth paradox\": AI's\nuser-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive\nfriction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and\nprovides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency\nrather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to\nresolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to\ndynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding\nprinciples, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)\nProgressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence\nincreases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual\nneeds and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing\nmental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.\nResearch across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains\nsupports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved\nself-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes\nsafeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias\namplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in\nhuman-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward\ngenuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and\ncontinuous learning."}

Our experiments demonstrate\nthat domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.\nAt the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models\nimprove QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving\nexams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the\npotential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education."}

A forward problem predicts the\noutput of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An\ninverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively\nmodel the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both\nproblems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the\ncost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.\nThis also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without\noverfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The\nprior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.\nResiduals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of\ncorresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to\neffectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior\nknowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss\nfunction and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the\nmodel parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and\ninverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with\nresiduals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and\nthen expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex\ndifferential equations.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences.

Unlike conventional software or static\ninference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these\nagents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal\ndata input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector\nDB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,\nwe need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.\n  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for\ndynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute\ninfrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and\nacross different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers\nseveral building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI\nexecution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and\nbandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and\ncompilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular\noperators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic\norchestration system that can place the granular components across a\nheterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an\nend-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and\npreliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can\ndeliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for\nsome workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer\naccelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU\ninfrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed\ninfrastructure."}

Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures.

In adaptive training (experiment 1), difficulty\nincreased based on individual performance.

To investigate, we ran the\nlargest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents\nacross 44 realistic deployment scenarios.

We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming\n(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across\n19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for\nmost behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across\nmodels and tasks.

In this paper, we present the first\nsystematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against\nnode classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client\naims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior\ncentralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in\ntraining, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained\nprivacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework\nthat exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding\nproximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We\nevaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.\nResults show that our method achieves high performance on both membership\ninference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy\nthreat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural\nand model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design."}

Evaluating these capabilities is\nbecoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a\n\\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to\nisolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \\textbf{user-centric}\nbilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000\ndialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds\nand abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across\nvarious user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit\nuser motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with\npractical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn\ndialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions\nand LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of\nconversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from\ncharacter background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap\nbetween academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a\nmore effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All\ncode and datasets will be released soon."}

Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit\nattention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,\nblock-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while\npreserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and\ncomprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic\ninnovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the\nincorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language\nmodels, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and\nhybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning\ntheoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to\nserve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and\nefficient language models."}

We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage.

We therefore introduce two\ntheoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the\nconfounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment\neffects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When\nthese structured measurements are only available for a non-representative\nsubset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias.

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard\nperformance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's\nefficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.

We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism.

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions.

These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.
