Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions.

To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or\none-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps\nnoise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first\nprinciples of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite\nintegrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term\nInterval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential\nrelationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals\nwithout resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we\nintroduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic\nconsistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the\ndifferential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit\nof our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This\nestablishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning\naverage velocity fields.

We provide both theoretical justifications of the\nnormalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on\ntwo popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its\ncounterparts (\\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with\nvanilla mSGDW."}

Although recent studies have explored\nheterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying\nresource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and\nlocal model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split\nLearning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device\nsystems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a\npersonalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to\nachieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models\ntailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and\nprivacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers\nclients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without\nsharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,\nenvironmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach\nbalances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high\nmodel accuracy.

Explainable AI (XAI)\nmethods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the\ncauses of the predictions. The majority of the existing XAI methods provide\nexplanations which are not convenient to convert into actionable\ncountermeasures. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based\ncounterfactual explanation framework that can provide actionable explanations\nfor network intrusion attacks. We evaluated our proposed algorithm against\nseveral other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3\nmodern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also\npresents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation\nalgorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our\nproposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the\ntested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by\nreducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how\ncounterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing\nthem to create a set of global rules.

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters.

While BaB can identify the\nsub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these\nsub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from\nan issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,\nconcerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.\nBased on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that\nexplores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more\nlikely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of\nthe verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it\nonly changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead\nto a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including\n$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that\nare more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy\ninspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to\nexploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally\nevaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5\nmodels with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10. Compared to the state-of-the-art\napproaches, we demonstrate the speedup of Oliva for up to 25X in MNIST, and up\nto 80X in CIFAR10."}

Unlike earlier efforts that used\ninteractive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI\nenables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust\nto interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.\n  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on\nlarge language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech\nsynthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative\nresearch, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order\nrandomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.\n  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot\nsurveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate\nhuman-administered survey to assess respondent experiences.

Existing GCIL methods\nprimarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed\nto belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge\nduring inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle\nunknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate\nout-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node\nembeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further\nproposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class\nprototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all\nunknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly\nmodels them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a\nrobust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN\nmethods."}

To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We\nrigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE\nsatisfies the asymmetric condition.

By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead.

A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "27 pages, 24 figures", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing\nresearch has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as\nmathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real\nworld reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of\nmultiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning\nskills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this\ngap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the\nRLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical\nreasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a\ncomprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO\nalgorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the\nmodels' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities\nwhen trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the\nintricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge\nduring combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence\nof SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base\nand instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we\ndelve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts\nof curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and\nlanguage-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer\nsignificant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing\nkey factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning\nperformance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL\nmethodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in\nLLMs."}

Model merging techniques have\nemerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present\nWarmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal\nconnection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a\nunified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including\ncosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model\naveraging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization\nmethods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training\nwindow for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model\nperformance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge\nquantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted\nWarmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving\nsignificant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on\nMMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning\nscenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement."}

ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technology\n  (IMWUT)", "summary": "Mindfulness training is widely recognized for its benefits in reducing\ndepression, anxiety, and loneliness. With the rise of smartphone-based\nmindfulness apps, digital meditation has become more accessible, but sustaining\nlong-term user engagement remains a challenge. This paper explores whether\nrespiration biosignal feedback and mindfulness skill estimation enhance system\nusability and skill development. We develop a smartphone's accelerometer-based\nrespiration tracking algorithm, eliminating the need for additional wearables.\nUnlike existing methods, our approach accurately captures slow breathing\npatterns typical of mindfulness meditation. Additionally, we introduce the\nfirst quantitative framework to estimate mindfulness skills-concentration,\nsensory clarity, and equanimity-based on accelerometer-derived respiration\ndata. We develop and test our algorithms on 261 mindfulness sessions in both\ncontrolled and real-world settings. A user study comparing an experimental\ngroup receiving biosignal feedback with a control group using a standard app\nshows that respiration feedback enhances system usability. Our respiration\ntracking model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.6 breaths per minute,\nclosely aligning with ground truth data, while our mindfulness skill estimation\nattains F1 scores of 80-84% in tracking skill progression. By integrating\nrespiration tracking and mindfulness estimation into a commercial app, we\ndemonstrate the potential of smartphone sensors to enhance digital mindfulness\ntraining."}
