### [2] [Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065)
*Sabrina Patania,Luca Annese,Cansu Koyuturk,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过社会中介学习范式提升大语言模型（LLM）在线知识获取能力，提出‘AI Social Gym’动态环境，实验表明对话式学习优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练范式依赖大数据集和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力，受维果茨基社会文化理论启发，研究探索社会中介学习的潜力。

Method: 引入‘AI Social Gym’环境，AI学习者与教师进行对话式交互，研究不同教学策略对知识获取的影响。

Result: 混合方向交互（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLM知识获取与应用能力，优于单向教学和直接访问结构化知识。

Conclusion: 将教学和心理洞察融入AI训练可显著改善知识获取和响应质量，为现有策略提供补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

### [3] [Product vs. Process: Exploring EFL Students' Editing of AI-Generated Text for Expository Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21073)
*David James Woo,Yangyang Yu,Kai Guo,Yilin Huang,April Ka Yeng Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了EFL中学生如何编辑AI生成的文本，发现编辑行为对写作质量提升有限，AI支持但不替代写作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的文本在EFL写作中应用增多，但其对学生写作过程和成果的影响尚不明确。

Method: 39名香港中学生参与实验，通过屏幕录制和作文分析，结合定性编码、统计分析和回归分析。

Result: AI生成字数对评分有正面影响，但编辑行为对质量提升作用有限。

Conclusion: 需结合体裁教学和过程写作，评估应重视过程和成果，以促进对AI文本的批判性使用。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

### [4] [Which symbol grounding problem should we try to solve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21080)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Floridi和Taddeo提出了一种解决基础问题的“零语义承诺”条件及其解决方案，但作者认为该条件无法实现，包括他们自己的方案。通过分析Luc Steels的竞争性建议，作者提出需要重新思考问题的本质以及系统中“目标”的作用。基于对计算的正确理解，作者认为唯一合理的基础问题是如何解释和复现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基础问题的解决方案，特别是Floridi和Taddeo提出的“零语义承诺”条件及其可行性。

Method: 分析Floridi和Taddeo的解决方案，对比Luc Steels的建议，并重新思考问题的本质和系统中“目标”的作用。

Result: 作者认为Floridi和Taddeo的条件无法实现，并提出了重新定义基础问题的观点。

Conclusion: 唯一合理的基础问题是如何解释和复现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [5] [ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21083)
*Franck Bardol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4对情感化提问的反应存在偏差，倾向于过度修正为中性或积极回应，尤其在敏感话题上更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感化提问如何影响GPT-4的回应，揭示模型在情感框架下的潜在偏差。

Method: 通过系统变化156个提示的情感基调，分析模型回应，引入“语气下限”和情感-效价转换矩阵量化行为。

Result: GPT-4对负面提问的负面回应概率比中性提问低三倍，敏感话题中情感影响被抑制。

Conclusion: 情感框架驱动的偏差是AI对齐和信任中未被充分探索的问题，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are
available at: https://github.com/bardolfranck/llm-responses-viewer

### [6] [Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084)
*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MNEME框架通过稀疏模型差异检测，识别LLMs微调或遗忘后的副作用，无需微调数据即可预测行为变化，准确率达95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法检测微调或遗忘后的副作用，如不可预测或突发的性能下降。

Method: MNEME通过稀疏模型差异比较基础模型和微调模型在任务无关数据上的表现。

Result: 在五种LLMs和三种场景中，MNEME预测副作用准确率达95%，且能通过高激活样本部分逆转效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展的自动化工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [7] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多业余模型对比解码（MACD）方法，通过集成多个业余模型更全面地捕捉语言生成中的失败模式，提升了文本生成的流畅性、连贯性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对比解码（CD）能提升文本生成的连贯性和流畅性，但其依赖单一业余模型限制了其对多样化生成失败模式的捕捉能力。

Method: MACD通过集成多个业余模型，采用平均和共识惩罚机制整合对比信号，并扩展了多业余场景下的合理性约束。

Result: 实验表明，MACD在多个领域（如新闻、百科和叙事）中均优于传统解码方法和原始CD方法，且无需额外训练或微调。

Conclusion: MACD通过多业余模型的集成，显著提升了文本生成的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

### [8] [QU-NLP at CheckThat! 2025: Multilingual Subjectivity in News Articles Detection using Feature-Augmented Transformer Models with Sequential Cross-Lingual Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21095)
*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的方法，用于检测新闻句子中的主观性，并在多语言和零样本设置中取得了竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CheckThat! 2025任务1中的主观性检测问题，即区分句子是表达作者主观观点还是客观事实。

Method: 采用特征增强的Transformer架构，结合预训练语言模型的上下文嵌入与统计和语言特征。针对不同语言使用不同的模型（如AraELECTRA和DeBERTa~V3），并通过门控机制整合TF-IDF特征。

Result: 在多种语言（英语、阿拉伯语、德语、意大利语等）的单语、多语和零样本设置中表现优异，部分语言排名靠前（如英语第一，罗马尼亚语第一）。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征和门控机制以及跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型的性能受跨语言微调顺序和训练语言的语言接近性影响。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

### [9] [Rewrite-to-Rank: Optimizing Ad Visibility via Retrieval-Aware Text Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21099)
*Chloe Ho,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Diya Sharma,Tanvi Reddy Anumandla,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过LLM重写广告内容来提升其在检索系统中的排名和生成响应中的出现频率，提出了一种监督微调框架和两个评估指标，实验表明PPO训练模型优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索广告内容表述对广告可见性的影响，特别是在LLM集成检索系统中，如何通过优化广告表述提升其排名和出现频率。

Method: 提出了一种监督微调框架，结合语义相关性和内容保真度的自定义损失函数，并引入了DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K两个评估指标。

Result: 实验显示，PPO训练模型在大多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告内容的表述方式、提示格式和强化学习在LLM集成检索系统中对广告重写的效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

topics and includes the participation of 18 professional interpreters of sign
language. A series of experiments using three state of the art translation
algorithms is presented. The aim is to establish a baseline for this dataset
and evaluate its usefulness and the proposed pipeline for data processing. The
experiments highlight the need for more localized datasets for sign language
translation and understanding, which are critical for developing novel tools to
improve accessibility and inclusion of all individuals. Our data and code can
be accessed.

### [11] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种客观测量阿拉伯语修辞密度的方法，通过分析文本中的文学手法密度来评估修辞使用情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管阿拉伯语修辞历史悠久且地位崇高，但缺乏客观方法评估其在文本中的使用程度和比较不同文本的修辞丰富性。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见文学手法的清单，构建了识别系统，并基于词素计数计算密度，开发了电子和模拟工具支持计算。

Result: 成功开发了一套工具，能够准确报告任何阿拉伯语文本或演讲中的修辞密度及其分布。

Conclusion: 该工具填补了阿拉伯语修辞量化评估的空白，为跨文本、作者和时代的修辞比较提供了客观依据。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

### [12] [Curved Inference: Concern-Sensitive Geometry in Large Language Model Residual Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21107)
*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种几何可解释性框架Curved Inference，用于分析大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的残差流轨迹弯曲情况，发现模型内部激活轨迹会随关注强度变化而改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的内部激活轨迹，揭示其如何通过几何结构导航和强化语义意义。

Method: 使用Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型，通过20个匹配提示（涵盖情感、道德等领域），计算曲率和显著性等指标，基于解嵌入矩阵的语义度量进行分析。

Result: LLaMA模型在关注强度增加时曲率和显著性显著提升，Gemma对关注变化反应较弱。研究支持了LLM几何的两层结构观点。

Conclusion: Curved Inference为诊断模型对齐和语义抽象提供了新方法，揭示了模型在深度上的语义导航机制。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

TL;DR: SemRAG是一种改进的检索增强生成框架，通过语义分块和知识图谱高效集成领域知识，避免大量微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将领域知识集成到大型语言模型中至关重要，但现有方法计算成本高且易过拟合。

Method: 使用语义分块算法和知识图谱结构，提升检索准确性和上下文理解。

Result: 实验表明SemRAG显著提升检索信息的相关性和正确性，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供高效、准确的领域特定LLM解决方案，具有可持续性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Trident-Bench基准，用于评估大语言模型在法律、金融和医疗领域的领域特定安全性，发现通用模型表现较好，而领域专用模型在伦理细节上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的广泛应用，领域特定安全性和合规性评估变得至关重要，但现有研究多关注性能提升，忽视了安全性评估。

Method: 基于专业伦理准则定义领域特定安全原则，并开发Trident-Bench基准，评估19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）满足基本安全要求，而领域专用模型在伦理细节上表现不佳，凸显领域特定安全改进的紧迫性。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为研究法律和金融领域的大语言模型安全性提供了系统资源，为未来减少部署风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何最有效地利用多样性提升LLMs在二元问题上的性能。

Method: 比较模型多样性和问题解释多样性，采用多数投票作为集成共识策略。

Result: 问题解释多样性在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa上表现更优，模型多样性效果介于最佳和最差集成成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Contrast-CAT的新方法，通过对比输入序列与参考激活来过滤无关特征，提升Transformer模型在文本分类中的解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释性不足，尤其是分类任务中，现有激活归因方法易受无关特征干扰，影响解释的可靠性。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列与参考激活，过滤掉类别无关特征，生成更清晰的归因图。

Result: 实验表明，Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，AOPC和LOdds指标分别提升1.30倍和2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT显著提升了Transformer模型在文本分类中的解释性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体成为公众表达对犯罪事件意见的重要平台，动态变化的公众情绪对政策制定和犯罪预防具有潜在价值。

Method: 使用新构建的28,528条孟加拉语评论数据集，采用XLM-RoBERTa Base架构的Transformer模型进行分类，并结合可解释AI技术。

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并识别出影响情感分类的关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中表现优异，可为公共政策制定提供实用见解。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语缺乏有效的自然语言处理工具，导致超党派新闻难以检测，影响公共讨论。

Method: 研究微调了Bangla BERT模型，并与传统机器学习模型对比，同时采用半监督学习和LIME解释模型决策。

Result: Bangla BERT在实验中表现优异，准确率达95.65%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，Transformer模型也能有效提升检测性能，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

*Christoph Metzner,Shang Gao,Drahomira Herrmannova,Heidi A. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床解释的额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的模型在临床文本分类中的性能和可解释性，发现其在资源充足时有效，但资源有限时表现不一致，且效果不如直接使用更多报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床解释作为额外监督是否能提升模型性能和可解释性，以优化临床文本分类任务。

Method: 分析了99,125条人类临床解释和128,649份电子病理报告，评估了基于Transformer的模型在提取原发癌症部位时的表现，并研究了用充分性作为预选解释的指标。

Result: 临床解释在资源充足时能提升性能，但资源有限时表现不一致；使用充分性预选解释效果不稳定；直接使用更多报告效果更优。

Conclusion: 若目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非生成解释；若注重可解释性，可考虑使用解释补充数据，但效果提升有限。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在捕捉跨文化道德差异方面表现不佳，倾向于压缩差异且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德观点的差异与相似性，以解决其训练数据中潜在的偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德分数方差、进行聚类对齐分析、直接通过系统选择的标记对进行模型测试。

Result: LLMs未能全面再现跨文化道德差异，且与调查数据对齐度低。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs以减少偏见并提升文化代表性，强调公平和伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Motivation: Shona语作为一种资源匮乏的语言，缺乏标注数据和复杂的音调特性，传统统计模型难以处理。研究旨在利用深度学习提升ASR系统的准确率。

Method: 采用混合架构（CNN用于声学建模，LSTM用于语言建模），结合数据增强、迁移学习和注意力机制以应对数据稀缺和音调问题。

Result: 系统表现优异，词错误率29%，音素错误率12%，整体准确率74%，优于传统统计模型。

Conclusion: 深度学习显著提升了Shona语ASR系统的性能，为资源匮乏语言的ASR技术发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估大型语言模型（LLM）在特定领域或组织文档中提取质量的基准，手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: StructText采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过多维评估策略确保文本与结构化数据对齐。

Result: 在71,539个示例和49个数据集上的评估显示，LLM在事实准确性上表现良好，但在叙事连贯性上存在困难。

Conclusion: StructText为键值提取研究提供了框架、数据集和评估工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的网页历史压缩方法，通过压缩历史状态中的任务相关信息，提升网页自动化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且冗长的网页状态导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，将每个历史状态中最相关的任务信息压缩为固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上实验，相比无历史输入的基线方法，准确率提高了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 历史压缩方法有效解决了网页状态冗长的问题，显著提升了网页自动化的性能。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了多轮交互中重复独立使用工具的效果，MemTool旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MemTool通过三种架构（自主代理模式、工作流模式、混合模式）动态管理工具上下文，并在ScaleMCP基准上评估其性能。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型模型中工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中型模型效率低（0-60%）；工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现稳定，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool提供了基于任务准确性、自主性和模型能力的模式选择建议，解决了多轮交互中的工具管理问题。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

Motivation: 旨在开发一种兼具高预测准确性和解释性的本地化LLM模型，以支持交通研究和政策制定，同时保障隐私和降低成本。

Method: 通过参数高效和损失掩码策略微调LLM，系统评估11种LLM模型，生成大量预测数据，并使用BERTopic和新型解释强度指数分析模型推理。

Result: LiTransMC在加权F1分数和Jensen-Shannon散度上优于未调优本地模型、大型专有系统（如GPT-4o）及传统方法，实现了高精度和分布校准。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合结构化行为预测和自然语言推理，可以开发出兼具预测能力和解释性的本地化LLM模型，为交通研究和政策制定提供新工具。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于任务多样性的数据选择方法，用于高效标注的监督微调（SFT），通过逆置信度加权策略选择样本，显著降低标注成本并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在专业应用中需要大量人工标注的问题，提出一种更高效的标注方法以减少时间和成本。

Method: 利用任务多样性作为数据选择原则，结合任务标签的可用性和预训练模型在不同任务上的置信度差异，设计了一种逆置信度加权采样策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MMLU分数上比完整数据集训练提升4%，且在不同标注预算下性能优于现有方法，标注成本降低高达80%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，显著降低了标注成本，同时提升了模型性能，适用于各种指令微调数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

TL;DR: 越南因互联网流量和在线毒性问题突出，需高效嵌入模型。VN-MTEB基准通过翻译和过滤英文样本构建，支持越南语嵌入模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南缺乏大规模测试数据集，阻碍AI模型在真实场景中的有效评估。

Method: 利用LLM和先进嵌入模型翻译并过滤英文样本，确保语言自然性和语义保真。

Result: 构建了包含41个数据集的越南语嵌入基准，发现Rotary Positional Embedding模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南语嵌入模型提供了高质量评估工具，助力实际应用。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

*Runjin Chen,Andy Arditi,Henry Sleight,Owain Evans,Jack Lindsey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过激活空间中的“角色向量”来监测和控制大型语言模型在部署和训练中可能出现的角色偏差的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在与用户交互时可能偏离预设的“助手”角色（如诚实、无害），需要一种方法来监测和控制这些偏差。

Method: 通过提取角色向量（如邪恶、奉承、幻觉倾向）来监测角色变化，并开发干预方法（如事后干预或预防性引导）来避免或纠正偏差。

Result: 角色向量能有效预测和控制在训练中的角色变化，且可通过干预方法避免不良变化。此外，角色向量还能用于识别可能导致不良变化的训练数据。

Conclusion: 角色向量是一种自动化、通用的方法，可用于监测和控制语言模型的角色偏差，适用于任何感兴趣的角色特征。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

### [33] [Model-free Speculative Decoding for Transformer-based ASR with Token Map Drafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21522)
*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无模型的推测解码技术（Token Map Drafting），用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，同时保持转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码（SD）方法需要额外的草稿模型，这在缺乏硬件加速器的设备上不切实际。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种无需草稿模型的高效解码方法。

Method: 利用预计算的n-gram token map（基于领域特定训练数据）进行推测解码，避免了单独草稿模型的需求。

Result: 在CI-AVSR数据集上实现了1.27倍的解码加速，内部数据集上实现了1.37倍加速，且未降低识别准确率。在CPU上比Distill-spec基线快10%。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种高效、无模型的推测解码技术，适用于资源受限设备上的ASR应用。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种新型的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，显著减少计算开销，提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态稀疏注意力方法通常降低准确性，而动态稀疏方法因运行时稀疏索引估计引入额外计算开销。

Method: 提出TriangleMix，浅层用密集注意力，深层用三角形稀疏模式。

Result: 实验显示，TriangleMix在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: TriangleMix能无缝结合动态稀疏方法，进一步提升速度，增强LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP在需求工程中应用广泛，但相关研究的可重复性未得到足够关注。论文旨在通过复制和扩展研究，验证NLP4RE的可重复性并探索新机会。

Method: 复制并扩展了一项基线研究，评估了不同模型在需求分类中的表现，包括BERT、ELMo和GPT-4o，并分析了其可重复性和泛化能力。

Result: 结果显示不同模型的可重复性水平各异，BERT和ELMo表现出良好的泛化能力，GPT-4o性能与传统模型相当。基线研究的可重复性得到确认，但环境设置文件缺失。

Conclusion: 论文通过复制和扩展研究验证了NLP4RE的可重复性，并提供了完整的复制包和ID卡，以支持未来研究的复制工作。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Motivation: 解决维吾尔语自然语言处理中的资源缺口，克服现有树库对黏着语处理的局限性。

Method: 设计包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 分析显示标注存在47.9%的系统性差异，证明了通用方案对维吾尔语结构的不足。

Conclusion: 现代维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）提供了更准确、语义透明的表示，为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的框架MAGIC，用于生成多样且微妙的知识冲突，以解决现有基准在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的局限性。实验表明，LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在知识冲突研究中存在局限性，如过于关注问答设置、依赖实体替换技术以及冲突类型有限。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱的框架，生成多样且微妙的冲突，并通过KG的显式关系结构确保可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳，且难以定位矛盾来源。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs在整合多样（甚至冲突）信息方面提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否能复现人类对复杂语言现象（形态模式）的敏感性，尤其是在不同频率条件下的表现。

Method: 采用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在自然、低频和高频动词分布下的表现。

Result: 模型在准确性上优于人类，但在响应偏好上不一致，且受训练数据中不规则动词比例的影响。

Conclusion: 模型与人类在语言处理上存在显著差异，尤其是在对形态模式的敏感性和响应偏好上。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD)，一种序列级知识蒸馏方法，通过生成多个翻译句子扩展教师模型分布，提升学生模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师模型的输出分布包含对学生模型有价值的信息，而传统beam search方法仅提供近似模式，限制了学生模型的学习范围。

Method: 利用beam search的n-best列表生成多个翻译，并探索其他解码方法以增加多样性和低频词的代表性。

Result: 低资源语言中，采样方法虽略微降低翻译质量，但增加了语料多样性和词汇丰富性，提升了学生模型性能并减少性别偏见放大。

Conclusion: MHD通过扩展教师模型分布，有效提升学生模型性能，尤其在低资源语言中表现显著。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Motivation: 当前奖励模型在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，且依赖精细标注的参考答案和固定输出格式，限制了RL数据扩展和模型推理能力的持续提升。

Method: 提出了一个推理导向的基准（Libra Bench）和改进生成奖励模型的新方法（学习思考方法），并开发了Libra-RM系列模型。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了现有奖励模型的局限性，为推理能力的持续提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注过滤安全提示，而忽略了总是引发有害输出的硬提示，UnsafeChain填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示，并明确纠正有害输出为安全响应。对三个LRMs进行微调，并与SafeChain和STAR-1进行比较。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中表现优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法在提升模型安全性和泛化能力方面有效。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在自然语言处理中表现优异，但对对抗攻击脆弱，影响其在实际应用中的鲁棒性。现有方法通常计算成本高。

Method: 提出一种附加模块，通过移除实例级主成分，将嵌入空间转换为近似高斯分布，减少对抗扰动的敏感性，同时保留语义关系。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上评估，该方法在保持基线攻击前精度的同时，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性和泛化性之间取得了平衡，无需对抗样本或昂贵的训练时增强。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

### [45] [The Problem with Safety Classification is not just the Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21782)
*Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）安全分类器的多语言差异及评估数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs安全分类器的有效性及其评估数据集在多语言场景中的不足。

Method: 通过分析5个安全分类模型在18种语言数据集上的表现，揭示多语言差异和数据集问题。

Result: 发现安全分类器的不足不仅源于模型本身，还与评估数据集有关。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发更好的多语言有害内容识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图表注释的碎片化和非标准化问题，提升可视化可访问性。

Conclusion: ChartMark为图表注释提供了一种标准化、可重用的解决方案。

Abstract: Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from
fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.
We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics
from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework
mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both
abstract intents and precise visual details. Our toolkit demonstrates
converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting
its flexibility, expressiveness, and practical applicability.

TL;DR: HRIPBench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在减少伤害信息提供中的准确性和安全风险的基准，结果显示现有模型仍存在严重问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在减少伤害信息提供中的表现，以改善药物使用者的健康和安全。

Method: 构建HRIPBench基准数据集（2,160个问答证据对），涵盖三个任务，并设计Instruction和RAG方案评估模型行为。

Result: 现有LLM在提供准确信息方面表现不佳，且可能对药物使用者造成严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少伤害场景中使用LLM需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了事件合理性变化，特别是由形容词修饰引发的变化，提出了使用句子转换器的新方法，并发现现有模型在此任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理和幻觉检测等任务至关重要，例如区分朋友间的温和讽刺与不友善行为。

Method: 使用句子转换器处理ADEPT挑战基准中的16K英语句子对，比较其与基于转换器的模型（如RoBERTa）的表现。

Result: 句子转换器在任务中表现不佳，甚至不如RoBERTa，且评估方法的不平衡影响了模型性能和结果可信度。

Conclusion: 需要更现实、平衡的评估方法，以准确衡量模型在合理性变化任务中的表现。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

*Andreas Reich,Claudia Thoms,Tobias Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALC是一种通用流程，用于系统构建针对任何编码任务和模型的最优提示，通过测试和验证，发现可靠提示策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛用于任务自动化，但提示策略的有效性因模型和任务而异，需要系统化方法。

Method: 提出HALC流程，测试1,512个提示策略，基于专家编码验证效果。

Result: 发现可靠提示策略（如Mistral NeMo模型下，单变量αclimate=0.76，双变量αclimate=0.71）。

Conclusion: HALC为不同任务和模型提供可靠提示策略，优化LLM编码效果。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

*Yifan Wei,Xiaoyan Yu,Yixuan Weng,Tengfei Pan,Angsheng Li,Li Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个基于强化学习的框架，使大型语言模型（LLMs）能自主决定是否及如何调用外部工具，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理（TIR）方法依赖固定的工具使用模式，可能损害语言模型的核心能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，因此需要更灵活的方法。

Method: AutoTIR通过强化学习框架，结合任务答案正确性、结构化输出和工具使用惩罚的混合奖励机制，优化推理和工具集成。

Result: 在多种任务中，AutoTIR表现优于基线方法，展示了更好的工具使用泛化能力。

Conclusion: AutoTIR证明了强化学习在构建可泛化和可扩展的TIR能力中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过强化学习优化GraphRAG，解决了传统方法的构建成本高、检索固定和依赖长上下文推理的问题，提升了推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GraphRAG方法存在构建成本高、检索固定和依赖长上下文推理的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Graph-R1框架，采用轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化。

Result: 实验表明，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统GraphRAG和强化学习增强的RAG方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习有效解决了GraphRAG的局限性，为检索增强生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段记忆-泛化框架，证明LLMs可以通过死记硬背数据实现泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨死记硬背是否阻碍泛化，并研究LLMs如何通过记忆数据实现泛化。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先用无意义标记记忆事实关联，再通过少量语义提示微调实现泛化。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化、语义对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 该发现为高效知识注入提供了可能，但也存在恶意利用记忆数据的风险。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

TL;DR: 研究发现，优化语言模型以表现温暖和共情会显著降低其可靠性，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在温暖性和可靠性之间的权衡，揭示当前评估方法可能忽略的系统性风险。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率上显著增加（+10到+30个百分点），更容易传播错误信息和验证用户错误信念。

Conclusion: 需重新思考如何开发和监管这些重塑人际关系的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的答案通常校准不佳，限制了其在推理任务中的可靠性。RLSF旨在通过模型自身的不确定性提供反馈，模仿人类学习方式。

Method: RLSF通过冻结的LLM生成多个链式推理答案，计算每个答案的置信度并排序，利用这些合成偏好优化模型策略，无需人工标签或外部奖励。

Result: RLSF改进了模型的概率估计和逐步推理能力，在算术推理和选择题任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RLSF证明了利用模型内在行为进行强化学习的有效性，为LLM后训练提供了数据高效的方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAG在跨文化食谱适应中的局限性，尤其是其无法生成多样化输出的问题。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，改进RAG的检索和上下文组织，以增强多样性。

Result: 实验表明CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上达到帕累托效率，优于封闭式LLM。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求多样化输出的RAG框架，有效解决了跨文化食谱适应中的多样性问题。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform traditional models in classifying microbial samples and predicting contamination risk using metadata alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generalizing microbiome studies with sparse metadata and heterogeneous labels.

Method: Evaluate LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, LLaMA 4) in zero-shot and few-shot settings against traditional models like Random Forests.

Result: LLMs excel in ontology classification and contamination risk prediction, generalizing across datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for metadata-only approaches in environmental microbiology and biosurveillance.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Result: 在多跳QA任务中，DeepSieve在推理深度、检索精度和可解释性上优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化、透明和适应性设计，显著提升了RAG框架的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 引入SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，结合信心量化和上下文继承，实现透明协作。

Result: 通过实证验证，SynLang成功支持AI适应结构化推理协议和元认知干预。

Conclusion: Symbiotic Epistemology和SynLang协议通过双层次透明性，增强人类智能并保持伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）辅助开发Synthea（开源合成健康数据生成器）的新疾病模块，以减少开发时间、降低专业需求、提升数据多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLMs辅助开发Synthea模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛并提升合成数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLMs支持模块开发的方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中展现出潜力，但也存在需人工监督、严格测试及内容准确性等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步探索LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力，并解决现有局限性。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过量化模型的“认知轮廓”来研究大语言模型（LLMs）的内部信息处理机制，重点关注熵衰减曲线和信息增益跨度（IGS）指数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型在任务上的表现（what），而本文旨在揭示模型如何处理信息（how），以更深入地理解其内部机制。

Method: 提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过熵衰减曲线（描述模型预测不确定性随上下文长度变化的曲线）和信息增益跨度（IGS）指数来量化模型的认知轮廓。

Result: 研究发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知轮廓，这些轮廓对模型规模和文本复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: 本文为分析和比较人工智能的内在操作动态提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知的学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人机协同决策系统的动态调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中对齐问题静态或事后处理的局限性，提出可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失。

Method: 引入对齐损失的形式化定义和元对齐概念，通过场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和结构化反馈实现可扩展操作循环。

Result: 在随机反馈下，对齐损失和监控保真度均收敛，实证显示NPO在大规模部署中具有可测量价值。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监控提供了紧凑、可检查的架构，将理论对齐保证与实际动态环境中的可靠性相结合。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险生活建议中的问题，发现其存在谄媚和过度自信的风险，并提出通过实验和激活导向改进安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险建议中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，研究旨在揭示这些问题并探索改进方法。

Method: 通过三项实验：多项选择评估、自由回答分析和机制可解释性实验，研究模型行为。

Result: 部分模型表现稳健，顶级模型通过频繁提问提高安全性，激活导向可直接控制模型谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需要多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，激活导向为安全性对齐提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Result: 两种指标与4/5网站的标注难度强相关，构建的通用评级系统能有效分类难度。

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能跨网站一致评估数独难度，并提供了初学者解法算法。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Motivation: 理解并可靠地减少大语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 为55个有害子概念学习线性探测，构建低秩有害子空间，通过子空间消融和主导方向操控减少危害性。

Result: 主导方向操控能几乎消除危害性且实用性损失小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解和控制大语言模型行为提供了可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以在高压力、时间敏感的环境中促进人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景（如应急响应）中，快速信任对有效人机协作至关重要，但现有XAI方法提供统一解释且依赖显式反馈，不适用于高压环境。

Method: 提出AXTF框架，利用生理和行为信号（如EEG、ECG、眼动追踪）推断用户状态，并通过多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF能够非侵入性地响应用户状态，提供个性化解释支持，从而增强人机协作中的快速信任。

Conclusion: AXTF为开发适应高压、时间敏感环境的自适应XAI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和交叉一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作缺乏明确的组件选择规则，依赖预定义集群且部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳，影响了协作效果。

Method: 采用自多样性（计算LLM内部输出的模糊匹配值）和交叉一致性（逐步剔除一致性低的LLM）机制优化集群协作。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，例如在NEJMQA的妇产科领域准确率达65.47%，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作能力，尤其在专业领域表现突出。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源在主动配电网中的普及，缺乏专业知识的运营商依赖人工专家成本高且耗时，亟需智能化的调度解决方案。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计包含信息提取器、问题构建器和代码编程器的多LLM协作架构，并开发针对性优化技术。

Result: 通过自然语言查询生成调度策略，降低了技术门槛，并在多种测试案例中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了ADN调度的智能化与灵活性，为缺乏专业知识的运营商提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned

Conclusion: 该框架具有更强的能力和可扩展性，适用于医学LLM的偏见检测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在语言解释过程中是否具有系统性组合能力，尤其是在将复杂问题映射为SPARQL查询时的表现。

Method: 生成基于DBpedia图模式的三个数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，通过不同提示和优化技术（如few-shot和微调）测试LLM。

Result: 实验显示，随着问题复杂度的增加，LLM的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，即使在输入中提供所有必要信息，最高F1分数仅为0.57。

Conclusion: LLM在系统性和组合性解释问题并将其映射为SPARQL查询方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Motivation: 传统方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间SLO达标率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

*Harsh Darji,Thibaud Lutellier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM的编码助手，通过生成澄清问题来减少用户提示的模糊性，从而提升代码生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成代码时因用户提示模糊而表现不佳，需要改进以更准确地理解用户意图。

Method: 构建了一个端到端系统，包括查询分类器和微调的LLM，用于检测模糊查询并生成澄清问题。

Result: 微调的LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其生成的代码更准确。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过生成澄清问题显著提升了代码生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强检索增强语言模型（RALM）可靠性的框架，通过结构化相关性评估、改进文档评分和知识整合，显著减少了事实错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RALM在文档相关性评估和知识整合中存在事实错误问题，需要一种更稳健的框架来提升其可靠性。

Method: 采用多维评分系统，结合语义匹配和来源可靠性，使用嵌入相关性评分和混合质量文档的合成训练数据。

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更可靠的问题回答系统提供了重要进展，但仍需解决信息可信度区分和系统延迟平衡的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出Trans-ACT方法，将交易分析（TA）原则嵌入多智能体系统（MAS），以生成具有现实心理动态的智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAS框架缺乏对人类行为认知复杂性的模拟，因此需要一种更贴近现实心理动态的方法。

Method: Trans-ACT将Parent、Adult和Child三种自我状态整合到智能体的认知架构中，利用情境记忆生成响应。

Result: 实验模拟显示，基于TA原则的智能体能够产生更深层次的情境感知交互。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和高级社会心理学研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

Motivation: 探索AI工具（特别是RAG）在复杂信息提取和标注任务中的实际应用效果，以提升效率和准确性。

Method: 采用被试内设计，随机分配任务，比较两种AI使用条件（“简单”和“交互式”）与纯人工基线的表现。

Result: AI工具（尤其是交互式条件）将任务速度提升10倍，并提高准确性，预计可节省268小时。标注者的AI工具技能也影响表现。

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具显著提升复杂标注任务的效率和准确性，标注者的AI技能是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理面临需求波动、库存失衡和牛鞭效应等问题，传统方法难以应对动态市场条件，而现有机器学习技术存在计算复杂性和效率不足的局限性。

Method: 采用LNN的动态特征提取能力和XGBoost的全局优化能力，构建混合模型，以同时满足供应链管理的适应性和效率需求。

Result: 该模型有望减少牛鞭效应，提升供应链的累积利润，填补现有方法的空白。

Conclusion: LNN与XGBoost的混合模型为动态和高效的供应链管理提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动信息收集的任务范式，通过强化微调策略训练LLMs，使其能识别上下文缺失并主动提问，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了部分指定的任务框架，采用强化微调策略，奖励模型提出能获取隐含用户信息的问题。

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于基线18%，人工评估中其澄清问题和最终方案分别获得42%和28%的偏好。

Conclusion: 主动澄清能力将LLMs从被动文本生成器提升为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量方法，用于更准确地预测大型语言模型在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大型语言模型（LLMs）的输出至关重要。现有的语义熵方法通过设定阈值衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量框架，扩展了现有阈值方法，并定义了三个基本性质来验证不确定性度量的有效性。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，Shapley不确定性在问答和其他数据集上比基线方法更准确地预测LLM的表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性是一种更有效的度量方法，能够更好地捕捉语义关系的连续性，从而提升对LLM输出的信任判断。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the

insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and

TL;DR: Evo-DKD是一个双解码器框架，结合结构化本体遍历和非结构化文本推理，用于自主本体演化，优于纯结构化或非结构化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体和知识图谱需要持续演化以保持全面性和准确性，但手动维护成本高。LLMs拥有大量非结构化知识，但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: Evo-DKD采用双解码器框架，一个生成本体编辑候选，另一个生成自然语言解释，通过动态注意力门控机制协调两者。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-DKD在本体更新精度和下游任务性能上优于纯结构化或非结构化方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD结合符号和神经推理，为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Motivation: To validate Sherpa Rx's performance in generating accurate pharmacogenomics responses by integrating CPIC and PharmGKB data.

Method: Used a dataset of 260 queries across 26 CPIC guidelines, comparing performance in two phases (CPIC-only vs. CPIC+PharmGKB) and against ChatGPT-4omini.

Result: Sherpa Rx achieved high scores (accuracy 4.9, recall 0.99) and outperformed ChatGPT-4omini in accuracy and completeness.

Conclusion: Integrating CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI performance, demonstrating Sherpa Rx's potential in pharmacogenomics.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM的表现优于单轮推理，并在低数据条件下媲美或超越机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

Motivation: 供应链管理中的决策工具虽然优化了决策，但业务规划者和高管仍需大量时间理解和调整模型，导致决策速度缓慢。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）来理解工具的输出、分析场景并更新数学模型，减少人工干预。

Conclusion: LLMs可以显著提升供应链技术的民主化，加速决策过程并提高效率。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供了关于世界模型表示的基础框架。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

TL;DR: ST-GDance是一种新颖的框架，通过解耦空间和时间依赖关系，优化长期且无碰撞的群舞生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群舞生成在影视、游戏和动画制作中有广泛应用，但现有方法难以建模密集的时空交互，导致可扩展性和碰撞问题。

Method: 采用轻量级图卷积进行距离感知的空间建模，以及加速稀疏注意力机制进行高效的时间建模。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance优于现有基线，尤其在生成长且连贯的群舞序列方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ST-GDance通过解耦时空依赖，显著降低了计算成本，同时确保流畅且无碰撞的交互。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization,
and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless
communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and
adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming

versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional
methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities,
including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and
self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法能更好地满足非专家用户需求，增强AI透明度和用户体验。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Conclusion: PHP方法通过平衡知识共享和任务特异性，有效解决了多任务增量学习中的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Method: 通过搜索和学习这两个现代AI的核心主题，对比分析了贝叶斯方法与当代具身智能方法的差异。

Result: 研究发现贝叶斯推理未在现代具身智能中发挥核心作用，且当前系统多局限于封闭物理环境。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法有望在推动具身智能向开放物理世界扩展中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Result: 实验表明，包含可读智能体的团队性能优于仅由标准最优行为智能体组成的团队。

Conclusion: 可读决策在多智能体团队协作中具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人事管理提供了灵活、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），提出SASA技术，通过投影中间层语义表示到早期安全层来增强安全性。

Result: 实验表明SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种无需微调的有效方法，能够利用模型内部语义理解来增强安全性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，利用图信号处理重新参数化，并通过最小化Bellman误差进行训练。

Result: 在网格环境中初步实验表明，BellNet能以更少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可迁移且统一的策略与值迭代表示，显著降低了推理复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP能有效解决跨数据集个体脑区分割的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed
citations, and abstentions. Inspired by the Prediction Powered Inference (PPI)
method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合条件变分因果推理模型（MCVCI）和混合条件变分因果聚类方法（MCVCC），用于推断异质性因果关系，并在模拟和真实数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异质性因果关系，而现有基于加性噪声的方法仅使用单一因果机制，无法适应这种复杂性。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型和神经网络的拟合能力，利用混合条件变分自编码器的概率边界似然作为因果决策标准，并建模因果异质性为聚类数。

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据上，MCVCI和MCVCC表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效推断异质性因果关系，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

*Junzhe Li,Yutao Cui,Tao Huang,Yinping Ma,Chun Fan,Miles Yang,Zhao Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种混合采样策略框架，结合SDE和ODE，通过滑动窗口机制优化MDP中的效率问题，显著提升训练速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO在图像生成的人偏好对齐中效率不足，因需对所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内使用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Result: MixGRPO在效率和性能上均优于DanceGRPO，训练时间减少50%，其变体MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略显著提升了效率和性能，为图像生成的人偏好对齐提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务驱动的业务流程设计在动态工业环境中缺乏灵活性和上下文感知能力，需要更智能的解决方案。

Result: 实现了更模块化、智能化的业务流程开发，适应动态工业环境。

Conclusion: 基于Agentic AI的目标驱动方法为工业自动化提供了更灵活和上下文感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DualSG框架，利用LLMs作为语义指导模块而非独立预测器，通过自然语言提示显式结合语义与数值预测，显著提升多变量时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLMs作为端到端预测器会导致数值精度损失，而潜在空间对齐方法常遇到对齐困难，因此需要一种新方法显式结合语义与数值预测。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，引入时间序列描述（Time Series Caption）作为自然语言提示，设计标题引导的融合模块显式建模变量关系。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种现有方法，验证了显式结合语义指导的价值。

Conclusion: DualSG通过显式语义指导显著提升了多变量时间序列预测性能，为LLMs在时间序列任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体环境中，理解其他智能体的信念和意图对有效交互至关重要。传统目标识别方法将观察者视为被动推理者，而AGR则主动收集信息以减少不确定性。

Method: 采用概率框架，结合联合信念更新机制和MCTS算法，无需领域特定知识即可高效推断目标。

Result: 在网格域中的实验表明，联合信念更新显著优于被动目标识别，且领域无关的MCTS表现与领域特定的贪婪基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且鲁棒的目标推断框架，推动了交互性和适应性的进步。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO算法能有效缓解优势崩溃问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过联合编辑多模态数据，有效解决了自动驾驶系统中的长尾分布问题，提升了感知模型的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Conclusion: 该框架为图数据提供了一种强大的神经符号方法，结合了学习和推理能力，适用于多样化的任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在自动分类GitHub README文件内容方面具有潜力，为提升仓库的识别度和使用率提供了自动化工具支持。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Conclusion: 该方法为不依赖LLM的零样本HAR提供了可行方案，展示了语言建模的潜力。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行移动网络中的根因分析（RCA），并通过两阶段训练方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络中的RCA需要可解释性、领域专业知识和因果推理，现有开源推理LLMs在此任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，生成结构化、多步骤的诊断解释。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个LLM规模上均显著优于现有推理和非推理模型，并能泛化到随机测试变体。

Conclusion: 领域适应和推理增强的LLMs在移动网络RCA中具有实际应用潜力，提升了可解释性和有效性。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对医学领域多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的高效压缩方法，结合结构剪枝和激活感知量化，显著降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医学领域潜力巨大，但计算成本高，需高效压缩技术以提升实用性。

Method: 提出新颖的剪枝层选择方法，分析不同量化技术，并在剪枝-微调-量化流程中评估性能权衡。

Result: 方法使7B参数的MLLMs在4GB显存内运行，内存使用减少70%，性能比传统压缩方法提升4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学领域的MLLMs提供了高效压缩方案，显著降低了资源需求并提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold huge potential for usage in the
medical domain, but their computational costs necessitate efficient compression
techniques. This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and
activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical
applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze
different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a
prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B
parameters to run within 4 GB of VRAM, reducing memory usage by 70% while
achieving 4% higher model performance compared to traditional pruning and
quantization techniques in the same compression ratio.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PHAX框架通过结构化论证生成面向不同健康利益相关者的解释，提升AI在公共卫生中的透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法缺乏对不同健康利益相关者的适应性和结构性，需更清晰、上下文相关且社会可问责的解释。

Method: PHAX结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知、面向特定受众的论证。

Result: PHAX在医学术语简化、医患沟通和政策论证等用例中展示了其增强解释性和信任的能力。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动公共卫生领域透明、以人为中心的AI发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

TL;DR: UI-AGILE框架通过改进训练和推理阶段，解决了多模态大语言模型在GUI代理中的推理设计、奖励无效和视觉噪声问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计困境、奖励无效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 1) 训练阶段：提出连续奖励函数、"简单思考"奖励和裁剪重采样策略；2) 推理阶段：引入分解定位与选择方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro上定位准确率提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架通过综合优化训练和推理，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和定位准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench是一个用户中心基准，用于评估LLM代理在多轮、偏好驱动的交互中的表现，揭示其在模糊目标下的协作能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达目标时，主动与用户协作的能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入UserBench基准，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具决策。

Result: 评估显示，代理任务完成与用户意图对齐率仅20%，高级模型主动揭示偏好不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理协作能力提供了评估环境，凸显其作为真正协作伙伴的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业培训方法难以平衡理论知识与实践经验，VR提供沉浸式、无风险的学习环境以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于VR的工业培训架构，包括高保真模拟、动态场景和自适应反馈系统，引入手势控制和VRTSS评分指标。

Result: 实验结果显示，VR培训显著提升信息保留、任务执行精度和整体培训效果。

Conclusion: VR是工业培训的关键工具，可替代传统方法，提供可扩展、互动和高效的学习体验。

Abstract: In contemporary training for industrial manufacturing, reconciling
theoretical knowledge with practical experience continues to be a significant
difficulty. As companies transition to more intricate and technology-oriented
settings, conventional training methods frequently inadequately equip workers
with essential practical skills while maintaining safety and efficiency.
Virtual Reality has emerged as a transformational instrument to tackle this
issue by providing immersive, interactive, and risk-free teaching experiences.
Through the simulation of authentic industrial environments, virtual reality
facilitates the acquisition of vital skills for trainees within a regulated and
stimulating context, therefore mitigating the hazards linked to experiential
learning in the workplace. This paper presents a sophisticated VR-based
industrial training architecture aimed at improving learning efficacy via
high-fidelity simulations, dynamic and context-sensitive scenarios, and
adaptive feedback systems. The suggested system incorporates intuitive
gesture-based controls, reducing the learning curve for users across all skill
levels. A new scoring metric, namely, VR Training Scenario Score (VRTSS), is
used to assess trainee performance dynamically, guaranteeing ongoing engagement
and incentive. The experimental assessment of the system reveals promising
outcomes, with significant enhancements in information retention, task
execution precision, and overall training efficacy. The results highlight the
capability of VR as a crucial instrument in industrial training, providing a
scalable, interactive, and efficient substitute for conventional learning
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前移动GUI代理仅能执行明确指令，缺乏主动预测用户意图和利用用户上下文信息的能力。

Method: 提出FingerTip基准，包含主动任务建议和个性化任务执行两个新任务，并收集了用户长期使用的多步Android交互数据。

Result: 实验表明，基于收集数据微调的模型能有效利用用户信息并取得良好效果。

Conclusion: FingerTip基准展示了构建更用户导向的移动GUI代理的潜力。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device
interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'
previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action
preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android
device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are
not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in
their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information.
Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned
with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved
good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more
user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.

Conclusion: 该框架为工业环境提供了实时、隐私保护的智能辅助解决方案，并计划公开数据集和源代码。

Abstract: Industrial assembly tasks increasingly demand rapid adaptation to complex
procedures and varied components, yet are often conducted in environments with
limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy requirements. These
constraints make conventional cloud-based or fully autonomous solutions
impractical for factory deployment. This paper introduces a mobile-device-based
assistant system for industrial training and operational support, enabling
real-time, semi-hands-free interaction through on-device perception and voice
interfaces. The system integrates lightweight object detection, speech
recognition, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a modular on-device
pipeline that operates entirely on-device, enabling intuitive support for part
handling and procedure understanding without relying on manual supervision or
cloud services. To enable scalable training, we adopt an automated data
construction pipeline and introduce a two-stage refinement strategy to improve
visual robustness under domain shift. Experiments on our generated dataset,
i.e., Gear8, demonstrate improved robustness to domain shift and common visual
corruptions. A structured user study further confirms its practical viability,
with positive user feedback on the clarity of the guidance and the quality of
the interaction. These results indicate that our framework offers a deployable
solution for real-time, privacy-preserving smart assistance in industrial
environments. We will release the Gear8 dataset and source code upon
acceptance.

Result: AI工具提升了学生反思能力和分析思维，但也引发认知过载和数据沉浸不足的问题。

Conclusion: 教育者主导的AI设计能促进反思性、负责任和协作性学习。

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

Motivation: 信任是人际关系中的关键因素，随着电子交互的普及，AI系统可能帮助用户理解社交状态。

Method: 评估LLMs在信任关系中的推理能力，并通过角色扮演实验测试其诱导信任的能力。

Result: LLMs能够在一定程度上推理信任关系，并可能通过特定行为诱导信任。

Conclusion: LLMs在信任关系的理解与诱导方面具有潜力，但需进一步研究验证其实际应用效果。

Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that
helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a
strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together
effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through
electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems
to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In
this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason
about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering
trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust
by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions
which can instil trust.

Result: 90%的类人AI代理排除了自闭症视角，AUTALIC基准可用于模型评估和微调。

Conclusion: 神经包容性AI是未来发展方向，AUTALIC为相关研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

Abstract: Games like Super Mario Maker 2 (SMM2) lower the barrier for casual users to
become level designers. In this paper, we set out to analyze a vast amount of
data about SMM2 user-written levels, in order to understand what factors affect
a level's difficulty as experienced by other users. To this end, we perform two
kinds of analyses: one based on regression models and one using natural
language processing techniques. The main results shed light on which level
characteristics (e.g., its style, popularity, timing) and which topics and
sentiments have a consistent association with easier or harder levels. While
none of our findings are startling, they help distill some key differences
between easy and hard SMM2 levels, which, in turn, can pave the way for a
better understanding of end-user level design.

Motivation: LGBTQ+青少年面临较高的社交孤立和自杀风险，元宇宙可能提供匿名、安全的支持环境。

Method: 使用Cluster平台，提供匿名、虚拟化身和可访问性，评估参与者的满意度、社交信心等指标。

Result: 79.2%的参与者选择符合性别认同的化身，社交信心显著提升，虚拟环境在安全性和自我表达方面得分更高。

Conclusion: 元宇宙支持小组能有效降低心理障碍，但需与线下服务结合，未来研究应关注整合虚拟与现实支持框架。

Abstract: This study assessed metaverse-based support groups designed to reduce social
isolation and suicide risk among LGBTQ+ youths. Using the Cluster platform,
enhanced anonymity, avatar-based self-expression, and accessibility were
provided. Key findings showed that 79.2% chose avatars matching their gender
identity, reporting high satisfaction (mean: 4.10/5) and low discomfort (mean:
1.79/5). Social confidence significantly improved in virtual spaces compared to
real-world interactions (p<0.001), particularly among participants with
initially low confidence, averaging an increase of 2.08 points. About half of
the first-time participants were 16 or younger, highlighting potential for
early intervention. The metaverse scored higher than real-world environments
for safety/privacy (3.94/5), self-expression (4.02/5), and accessibility
(4.21/5). Additionally, 73.6% reported feeling more accepted virtually.
However, some highly confident individuals offline experienced mild adaptation
challenges, averaging a confidence decrease of 0.58 points, indicating virtual
support complements rather than replaces in-person services. These findings
suggest metaverse-based support effectively lowers psychological barriers and
provides affirming spaces, potentially reducing severe outcomes such as
suicidal ideation. Future studies should focus on integrating virtual support
with existing community and clinical frameworks to enhance long-term impacts.

Motivation: 研究解释行为作为一种社会互动时情感的作用，填补了现有研究中对情感因素的忽视。

Method: 开发了一种计算框架，建模解释者如何考虑听众的情感反应，并通过实验验证模型预测人类直觉的能力。

Result: 模型能较好地预测人类直觉，优于不考虑情感的基线模型，表明人们在解释时确实会考虑情感因素。

Conclusion: 情感在解释行为中扮演重要角色，未来的解释模型应纳入情感因素。

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

stakeholders' profiles in terms of technical and pedagogical characteristics.
The qualitative data collected was analysed using deductive thematic analysis
with Activity Theory, explicating the user needs. The second workshop
articulated expectations related to the integration of AI in education.
Inductive thematic analysis of the second workshop led to the elicitation of
users' expectations. We cross-examined the needs and expectations, identifying
contradictions, to generate user requirements for emerging technologies. The
paper provides suggestions for future design initiatives that incorporate AI in
learning environments.

*Xiaotian Su,Naim Zierau,Soomin Kim,April Yi Wang,Thiemo Wambsganss*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出并评估了两种情绪监控仪表板，旨在提升用户情绪意识并减少仇恨言论。研究发现这些方法有效，但也可能增加负面情绪的表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管社交媒体平台采取了主动审核措施，但仍存在审查氛围和未能解决不文明行为根本原因的问题。研究旨在通过情绪监控工具改善这一状况。

Method: 研究设计了两种情绪监控仪表板，并在211名参与者中评估其对用户评论行为和情绪体验的影响。

Result: 干预措施提高了用户的情绪意识并减少了仇恨言论，但也可能增加负面情绪的表达（如愤怒、恐惧和悲伤）。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在社交媒体平台中整合主动情绪调节工具提供了基础，以促进更健康的数字互动。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

*Yiling Zhao,Audrey Michal,Nithum Thain,Hari Subramonyam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究表明，交互式模拟能有效提升AI素养，支持知识迁移和自信心，但单纯参与并不保证学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如博客、静态课程）难以支持深度理解和批判性思考，需探索更有效的方法。

Method: 通过交互式模拟，让学习者参与假设测试、实验和观察AI行为，研究其对AI概念学习的影响。

Result: 605名参与者的研究表明，交互式模拟显著提升了AI素养，尤其在公平性、数据集代表性和语言模型偏见方面。

Conclusion: 交互式、探究驱动的方法能更好地帮助人们批判性地理解和应用AI。

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can
better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.

TL;DR: VizGenie是一个基于LLM的自改进框架，通过动态生成模块和自然语言接口提升科学可视化能力，减少认知负担并支持可重复研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学可视化中复杂任务的高认知负担和技术实现门槛，通过LLM和动态模块扩展功能。

Method: 结合预置工具和LLM生成的脚本，利用VQA和RAG技术实现自然语言交互和上下文驱动响应。

Result: 在复杂体数据上显著降低迭代可视化任务的认知开销，提升灵活性和适应性。

Conclusion: VizGenie通过LLM和动态模块的集成，实现了可持续进化的科学可视化平台。

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

### [142] [Impact of eHMI on Pedestrians' Interactions with Level-5 Automated Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21303)
*Viktoria Marcus,Griffin Pitts,Sanaz Motamedi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究表明，外部人机界面（eHMIs）能显著提升行人对自动驾驶系统的理解和信任，增强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球每年超过一半的交通事故涉及弱势道路使用者（如行人），主要因人为错误。自动驾驶系统（ADSs）可能减少此类错误，但其效果取决于其他道路使用者的理解。

Method: 通过在线调查，153名参与者对包含和不含eHMIs的自动驾驶场景做出反应，评估行人的行为和心理反应。

Result: 使用eHMIs时，行人更早、更自信地过马路，安全感和信任感显著提升。视觉eHMI功能比听觉功能更受重视。

Conclusion: eHMIs能显著提升行人对自动驾驶意图的理解，增强安全感和信任，促进更直观的交互。

Abstract: Each year, over half of global traffic fatalities involve vulnerable road
users (e.g. pedestrians), often due to human error. Level-5 automated driving
systems (ADSs) could reduce driver errors contributing to pedestrian accidents,
though effectiveness depends on clarity and understandability for other road
users. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed to
facilitate pedestrian-ADS communication, though consensus on optimal eHMI
features remains unclear. In an online survey, 153 participants responded to
road-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs, with and without eHMIs. With
eHMIs, pedestrians crossed earlier and more confidently, and reported
significantly increased perceptions of safety, trust, and understanding when
interacting with level-5 ADSs. Visual eHMI features (including a text display
and external speedometer) were ranked more necessary than auditory ones, though
auditory cues received positive feedback. This study demonstrates that eHMIs
can significantly improve pedestrians' understanding of level-5 ADS intent and
enhance perceived safety and trust, facilitating more intuitive pedestrian-ADS
interactions.

TL;DR: ProMemAssist是一种智能眼镜系统，通过多模态传感器实时建模用户的工作记忆，提供更精准的辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可穿戴AI系统通常依赖用户启动或预定义任务知识，忽略了用户的当前心理状态。

Method: 系统基于工作记忆认知理论，将感知信息建模为记忆项和片段，并通过编码机制（如置换和干扰）实时预测辅助时机。

Result: 在12名参与者完成认知要求任务的用户研究中，ProMemAssist比基于LLM的系统提供了更精准的辅助，并获得更高参与度。

Conclusion: 工作记忆建模能实现更细致、上下文敏感的辅助，为设计更关注用户的主动代理提供了启示。

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强物理数据叙事方法，通过物理对象交互控制可视化，开发了原型InSituTale，用户研究表明其直观且实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要依赖手势或语音控制可视化，物理对象交互未被充分探索，需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过调查数据驱动演示确定常见可视化命令，与专家研讨收集物理操作映射，开发结合深度摄像头和Vision-LLM的原型InSituTale。

Result: 用户研究表明InSituTale支持直观交互，实用性强，能提供引人入胜的演示体验。

Conclusion: 增强物理数据叙事方法有效结合物理与数字元素，提升了数据叙事的连贯性和互动性。

Abstract: Augmented data storytelling enhances narrative delivery by integrating
visualizations with physical environments and presenter actions. Existing
systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control
visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely
underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach
enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object
interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of
data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then
conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between
physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we
developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth
camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical
manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization
commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical
and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that
InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates
an engaging presentation experience.

*JIaheng Wang,Yucun Zhong,Chengjie Huang,Lin Yao*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MindChat是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的脑机接口（BCI）拼写器，通过减少用户手动按键次数提升拼写效率。实验显示，与传统BCI拼写器相比，MindChat节省了62%的按键次数和32%的拼写时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前BCI拼写器因依赖逐字母输入和解码不准确导致效率低下，限制了其在现实沟通中的应用。MindChat旨在通过LLM辅助提升拼写效率。

Method: 利用提示工程（prompt engineering）驱动LLM（如GPT-4o）在拼写过程中提供上下文感知的单词和句子补全/预测。

Result: 在线拼写实验表明，MindChat在四种对话场景中显著减少按键次数（62%）和拼写时间（32%）。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的高速BCI拼写器有望实现真正的实用化应用。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers can render a new communication
channel independent of peripheral nervous system, which are especially valuable
for patients with severe motor disabilities. However, current BCI spellers
often require users to type intended utterances letter-by-letter while spelling
errors grow proportionally due to inaccurate electroencephalogram (EEG)
decoding, largely impeding the efficiency and usability of BCIs in real-world
communication. In this paper, we present MindChat, a large language model
(LLM)-assisted BCI speller to enhance BCI spelling efficiency by reducing
users' manual keystrokes. Building upon prompt engineering, we prompt LLMs
(GPT-4o) to continuously suggest context-aware word and sentence
completions/predictions during spelling. Online copy-spelling experiments
encompassing four dialogue scenarios demonstrate that MindChat saves more than
62\% keystrokes and over 32\% spelling time compared with traditional BCI
spellers. We envision high-speed BCI spellers enhanced by LLMs will potentially
lead to truly practical applications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究了触觉图表是否有助于盲人和低视力（BLV）个体理解复杂可视化，提出了四种触觉图表设计并通过访谈研究验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化是传达数据的强大工具，但BLV个体通常只能依赖替代文本等辅助技术获取信息，缺乏构建图表类型心智模型的手段。

Method: 与两名BLV研究者合作，设计了四种高级图表类型的3D打印触觉模板，并进行了12名BLV参与者的访谈研究。

Result: 触觉模型支持图表类型理解，是BLV个体首选的学习方法。

Conclusion: 触觉图表有助于BLV个体构建心智模型，提升对复杂图表的理解能力。

Abstract: We investigate whether tactile charts support comprehension and learning of
complex visualizations for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and
contribute four tactile chart designs and an interview study. Visualizations
are powerful tools for conveying data, yet BLV individuals typically can rely
only on assistive technologies -- primarily alternative texts -- to access this
information. Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart
types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to
build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts
show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental
models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple
chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more
complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two
BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with
exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin
plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an
interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile
templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this
understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts.
Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding
and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report
participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨学科领域（如生物信息学）中，学习者面临复杂信息空间的挑战，GenAI可能改变其信息搜索行为。

Method: 采用自民族志方法，研究GenAI聊天机器人对学习者导航行为和信息识别的影响。

Result: GenAI在学习计划明确后支持导航，但之前可能无效；传统信息源（如项目符号）在GenAI中效果较差。

Conclusion: GenAI在跨学科学习环境中需谨慎使用，因其效果取决于学习阶段和领域知识。

Abstract: This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on
the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize
the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to
navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further
compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied
prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences
information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a
GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do
learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an
autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to
support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was
counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information
sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when
applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized
through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These
findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with
caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.

Motivation: 随着AI工具在高等教育中的普及，了解学生如何与这些系统互动对支持有效学习至关重要。

Method: 基于自我决定理论和用户体验研究，通过309名本科生调查数据，采用偏最小二乘结构方程模型分析AI素养、可用性、满意度、参与度和学习效果的关系。

Result: AI素养显著预测工具的可用性、满意度和参与度，进而影响学习效果；而先前的AI接触无显著影响。

Conclusion: AI素养而非接触经验塑造学生体验，设计者应整合适应性指导和用户中心功能以支持不同素养水平，促进包容、激励和有效的AI学习环境。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

Motivation: 当前研究缺乏针对AR的上下文特定设计建议，尤其是在用户中心设计过程的评估阶段。

Method: 采用多方法分析，包括扩展数据集、NLP分类、内容总结和专家评估。

Result: 提供了597条设计建议，分类为84个主题，其中32个主题（284条建议）适用于AR企业培训。

Conclusion: 研究为AR用户体验测量方法提供了扩展支持，有助于改进AR在企业培训中的应用。

Abstract: Innovative technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), introduce new
interaction paradigms, demanding the identification of software requirements
during the software development process. In general, design recommendations are
related to this, supporting the design of applications positively and meeting
stakeholder needs. However, current research lacks context-specific AR design
recommendations. This study addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing
practical AR design recommendations relevant to the evaluation phase of the
User-Centered Design (UCD) process. We rely on an existing dataset of Mixed
Reality (MR) design recommendations. We applied a multi-method approach by (1)
extending the dataset with AR-specific recommendations published since 2020,
(2) classifying the identified recommendations using a NLP classification
approach based on a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, (3) summarizing the
content of all topics, and (4) evaluating their relevance concerning AR in
Corporate Training (CT) both based on a qualitative Round Robin approach with
five experts. As a result, an updated dataset of 597 practitioner design
recommendations, classified into 84 topics, is provided with new insights into
their applicability in the context of AR in CT. Based on this, 32 topics with a
total of 284 statements were evaluated as relevant for AR in CT. This research
directly contributes to the authors' work for extending their AR-specific User
Experience (UX) measurement approach, supporting AR authors in targeting the
improvement of AR applications for CT scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉场景显示（VSD）作为辅助沟通设备对非语言自闭症儿童的语言发展非常有效，但其配置难度限制了广泛应用。研究旨在通过生成式AI简化配置过程。

Method: 开发了一个原型，利用生成式AI自动为图像生成热点建议。通过用户研究（预科语言病理学学生）评估原型在效率、质量和用户信心方面的表现。

Result: 结果好坏参半：用户效率与信心提升，但也存在过度依赖和沟通选项同质化等负面影响。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在辅助技术中的应用需进一步研究以识别和解决潜在风险。

Abstract: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices are used by many
people around the world who experience difficulties in communicating verbally.
One AAC device which is especially useful for minimally verbal autistic
children in developing language and communication skills are visual scene
displays (VSD). VSDs use images with interactive hotspots embedded in them to
directly connect language to real-world contexts which are meaningful to the
AAC user. While VSDs can effectively support emergent communicators, their
widespread adoption is impacted by how difficult these devices are to
configure. We developed a prototype that uses generative AI to automatically
suggest initial hotspots on an image to help non-experts efficiently create
VSDs. We conducted a within-subjects user study to understand how effective our
prototype is in supporting non-expert users, specifically pre-service
speech-language pathologists (SLP) who are not familiar with VSDs as an AAC
intervention. Pre-service SLPs are actively studying to become clinically
certified SLPs and have domain-specific knowledge about language and
communication skill development. We evaluated the effectiveness of our
prototype based on creation time, quality, and user confidence. We also
analyzed the relevance and developmental appropriateness of the automatically
generated hotspots and how often users interacted with the generated hotspots.
Our results were mixed with SLPs becoming more efficient and confident.
However, there were multiple negative impacts as well, including over-reliance
and homogenization of communication options. The implications of these findings
reach beyond the domain of AAC, especially as generative AI becomes more
prevalent across domains, including assistive technology. Future work is needed
to further identify and address these risks associated with integrating
generative AI into assistive technology.

TL;DR: VeasyGuide通过动态高亮和放大教师动作，帮助低视力学习者更轻松地捕捉视觉线索，显著减少认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育视频中教师的视觉动作（如指向、标记）缺乏口头描述，低视力学习者难以捕捉，导致信息遗漏和认知负担增加。

Method: 与低视力参与者共同设计VeasyGuide，利用运动检测技术动态高亮和放大教师动作，并提供个性化实时反馈。

Result: 8名低视力参与者显著提高了动作检测能力，反应时间缩短，认知负担减轻；8名视力正常参与者也表现出更高的专注度。

Conclusion: VeasyGuide不仅对低视力学习者有益，还具有普遍适用性，能提升学习效果。

Abstract: Instructors often rely on visual actions such as pointing, marking, and
sketching to convey information in educational presentation videos. These
subtle visual cues often lack verbal descriptions, forcing low-vision (LV)
learners to search for visual indicators or rely solely on audio, which can
lead to missed information and increased cognitive load. To address this
challenge, we conducted a co-design study with three LV participants and
developed VeasyGuide, a tool that uses motion detection to identify instructor
actions and dynamically highlight and magnify them. VeasyGuide produces
familiar visual highlights that convey spatial context and adapt to diverse
learners and content through extensive personalization and real-time visual
feedback. VeasyGuide reduces visual search effort by clarifying what to look
for and where to look. In an evaluation with 8 LV participants, learners
demonstrated a significant improvement in detecting instructor actions, with
faster response times and significantly reduced cognitive load. A separate
evaluation with 8 sighted participants showed that VeasyGuide also enhanced
engagement and attentiveness, suggesting its potential as a universally
beneficial tool.

Abstract: Visualizations are essential tools for disseminating information regarding
elections and their outcomes, potentially influencing public perceptions.
Personas, delineating distinctive segments within the populace, furnish a
valuable framework for comprehending the nuanced perspectives, requisites, and
behaviors of diverse voter demographics. In this work, we propose making
visualizations tailored to these personas to make election information easier
to understand and more relevant. Using data from UK parliamentary elections and
new developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), we create personas that
encompass the diverse demographics, technological preferences, voting
tendencies, and information consumption patterns observed among
voters.Subsequently, we elucidate how these personas can inform the design of
visualizations through specific design criteria. We then provide illustrative
examples of visualization prototypes based on these criteria and evaluate these
prototypes using these personas and LLMs. We finally propose some actionable
insights based upon the framework and the different design artifacts.

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种人机协作的工作流程，用于为基于SVG的隐喻可视化设计动画，通过视觉语言模型生成动画片段，并通过用户研究验证了其创意支持和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计隐喻可视化动画存在挑战，如语义对齐、数据表示和交互集成。

Method: 采用人机协作工作流程，利用视觉语言模型生成动画片段，并通过原型工具DataSway实现。

Result: 用户研究（N=14）验证了工具的创意支持和可用性，展示了6个案例的应用。

Conclusion: 为未来定制化数据可视化动画研究提供了启示。

Abstract: Animating metaphoric visualizations brings data to life, enhancing the
comprehension of abstract data encodings and fostering deeper engagement.
However, creators face significant challenges in designing these animations,
such as crafting motions that align semantically with the metaphors,
maintaining faithful data representation during animation, and seamlessly
integrating interactivity. We propose a human-AI co-creation workflow that
facilitates creating animations for SVG-based metaphoric visualizations. Users
can initially derive animation clips for data elements from vision-language
models (VLMs) and subsequently coordinate their timelines based on entity
order, attribute values, spatial layout, or randomness. Our design decisions
were informed by a formative study with experienced designers (N=8). We further
developed a prototype, DataSway, and conducted a user study (N=14) to evaluate
its creativity support and usability. A gallery with 6 cases demonstrates its
capabilities and applications in web-based hypermedia. We conclude with
implications for future research on bespoke data visualization animation.

*Prital Bamnodkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为TFC-SR的持续学习方法，通过结合主动回忆、刻意练习和间隔重复等人类学习策略，显著缓解了深度神经网络中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在持续学习新任务时会出现灾难性遗忘问题，导致过去任务的性能下降。本文旨在通过模仿人类学习策略来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TFC-SR方法，引入主动回忆探针（Active Recall Probe），通过周期性、任务感知的评估来稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split MNIST和Split CIFAR-100基准测试中，TFC-SR显著优于其他方法，例如在Split CIFAR-100上达到13.17%的准确率，而标准回放方法仅为7.40%。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且稳健的持续学习方法，强调了将主动记忆检索机制整合到持续学习系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Motivation: 探索量子认知机器学习的潜力，通过量子几何描述数据，避免局部方法的维度灾难。

Method: 使用Hermitian矩阵表示数据特征，将数据点映射到Hilbert空间，并提取量子几何结构（如量子度量、Berry曲率）。

Result: QCML能够捕捉数据的全局特性，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QCML的量子几何表示可能推动量子认知框架下对认知现象的理解。

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as
quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our

Method: 提出3种独立性准则，设计无监督和监督降维方法，并在线性和非线性设置下评估对比、准确性和可解释性。

Result: 方法在性能上优于基线（tSNE、PCA、正则化LDA、VAE等），并开创了可解释机器学习的新方向。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究者提供了一种新的可解释机器学习工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Result: 实验验证了所提方法在野火预测中的有效性，能够在不降低性能的情况下使用更小的数据块。

Conclusion: 形态学课程对比学习为解决野火预测中的挑战提供了有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Conclusion: DPST方法为下一代大规模MIMO系统提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables
efficient, interpretable, and low-complexity MIMO signal detection. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates
natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal
processing tasks. The proposed algorithm requires only a small number of
trainable parameters, allowing for simplified training. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance
with fewer iterations and lower computational complexity, making it a practical
solution for next-generation massive MIMO systems.

Conclusion: SPADE-S有效解决了时间序列预测中的幅度和稀疏性问题，为实际应用提供了更准确的预测结果。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,
respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to

Conclusion: 分布偏移是机器学习中的重要挑战，需进一步研究以开发更鲁棒的模型。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督异常检测和医学影像应用中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为最大似然估计问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，MaPPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MaPPO将先验奖励估计整合到最大后验目标中，扩展了现有方法，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MaPPO显著提高了对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: EvoSLD在准确性、可解释性和效率上优于基线方法，有望加速AI研究。

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

Motivation: 临床LLMs在输入微小变化（如症状掩盖或否定）时表现不佳，但标准NLP指标无法检测这种潜在表示变化。

Method: 通过结构化提示生成临床笔记，并沿四个轴（掩盖、否定、同义词替换和数值变化）进行扰动，计算PCA降维空间中的LDFR。

Conclusion: 几何感知审计对安全关键的临床AI至关重要，揭示了表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如卷积、循环或注意力网络）在图学习中缺乏透明性和效率，因此需要一种更可解释且资源高效的方法。

Method: 使用GLWT分解图信号，通过非线性收缩和符号逻辑处理小波系数，并结合特定领域语言（DSL）进行组合推理。

Result: 在合成图去噪和语言标记图任务中表现优于轻量级GNN，且透明性和效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提供了一种可解释、资源高效的替代方案，优于传统深度神经网络。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures
for learning on graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过结构学习重连浅层GCN边的方法，以解决异质图中长距离依赖捕获不足的问题，但方法在节点分类任务中表现不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异质图中由于局部特征聚合导致的长距离依赖捕获不足问题，避免因过度平滑导致的下游任务性能下降。

Method: 通过参数化邻接矩阵学习非局部节点间的连接，扩展浅层GCN的跳数范围，以捕获长距离依赖。

Result: 方法在异质图中表现不一致，且无法泛化到所有异质图结构。

Conclusion: 提出的结构学习方法虽能改善长距离依赖捕获，但受限于图结构，性能不稳定。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework
that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario
training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks.
EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of
digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in
contested environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）数据的复杂性和异质性限制了其在子群体特定建模中的效果，需要一种方法将解释性转化为实际指导。

Method: 结合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，识别临床有意义的子群体特征，优化模型训练和评估。

Result: 在三个大型EHR数据集上验证，AdaptHetero能有效识别ICU死亡率、院内死亡和隐藏性低氧血症的异质性模型行为，提升预测性能。

Conclusion: AdaptHetero通过解释性驱动的子群体建模，显著提升了EHR数据的预测效果和临床实用性。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: Grab是一种针对语言模型的梯度反转攻击方法，通过混合优化显著提高了隐私数据恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示联邦学习中语言模型的隐私威胁，此前因离散数据特性而被低估。

Method: 采用混合优化，包括层间dropout掩码优化和离散token序列优化。

Result: 恢复率高达92.9%，比现有方法提升28.9%（基准）和48.5%（实际）。

Conclusion: Grab为理解语言模型联邦学习的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

Motivation: 现有IMAs依赖多个LLM，导致资源浪费和效率低下。本文旨在通过单LLM实现多样化IMAs，并解决其在移动环境中的适应性和效率问题。

Method: 提出ContextLoRA方法，通过任务依赖图引导LLM学习IMAs的结构化上下文，并分阶段微调。ContextGear策略优化训练过程，减少计算和通信成本。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，并在实际无线测试平台上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 单组合LLM范式在IMAs中具有高效性和实用性，ContextLoRA和ContextGear为资源受限环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分布通常不均衡且长尾，传统算法在此类数据上表现不佳，需开发能直接从非完美数据中学习的鲁棒算法。

Method: 论文分为四部分：1）从长尾数据学习生成模型；2）通过归纳正则化提升尾部类别的泛化能力；3）半监督学习优化相关指标；4）高效领域自适应。

Result: 开发了能够从有限或不完美数据中学习的算法，解决了模式崩溃、泛化能力不足等问题，并实现了高效的领域自适应。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了现实世界数据分布不均衡的问题，减少了数据标注的需求，推动了深度学习在真实场景中的应用。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，能够自主预测沸腾动力学，无需依赖模拟数据，并在多相沸腾流中取得了新的基准结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理时需要未来输入（如气泡位置），无法从过去状态学习成核现象，且无法建模流动沸腾速度场，限制了其自主预测能力。

Method: Bubbleformer结合了因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放和热物理参数条件化，以泛化到不同流体、几何和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流方面取得了新的基准结果，并提出了基于物理的可解释性指标。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过创新的模型设计和高质量数据集BubbleML 2.0，显著提升了沸腾动力学的建模能力。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Result: 在复杂重建任务中，Adam-PnP显著提高了重建精度。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为多源数据驱动的蛋白质结构重建提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

Motivation: 传统多项式混沌展开（PCE）在高维问题中因基函数数量指数增长而难以扩展，限制了其应用。

Method: 结合PCE与概率电路的思想，提出DeepPCE，一种深度化的PCE方法，适用于高维输入空间。

Result: DeepPCE在预测性能上与多层感知机（MLP）相当，同时保留了PCE通过简单前向传播计算精确统计推断的能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE是一种高效且可扩展的替代方法，适用于高维不确定性量化问题。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

Conclusion: LAAC有效整合LLM知识，无需昂贵微调，为推荐系统提供了一种平衡多样性和相关性的解决方案。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 混合方法在多种情况下均能显著提升时间序列预测能力，证明了结合物理模型与数据驱动的有效性。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Conclusion: 神经符号框架在稀疏数据下有效重建和模拟弹性物体，兼具数据驱动和物理约束的优势。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

Conclusion: CDNet通过对比扩散方法有效解决了复杂数据条件下的时间序列分类问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

Result: 实验表明，ECHO在不同车辆和节点数量下均优于现有最优方法，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ECHO通过创新方法有效解决了MMHCVRP问题，并通过消融研究验证了各方法的有效性。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EpochCore的专用硬件加速器，用于加速状态空间模型（SSMs），通过创新的微架构和数据流设计，显著提升了性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时存在内存限制问题，而SSMs虽然能有效处理长序列，但其训练和推理计算密集且耗能。因此，需要一种专用硬件加速器来优化SSMs的性能和能效。

Method: 设计了基于脉动阵列（SAs）的EpochCore加速器，并提出了LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，以支持传统DNN和SSMs的高效执行。

Result: EpochCore在性能和能效上分别实现了250倍和45倍的提升，尽管面积成本增加了2倍，但在LRA数据集上的推理延迟比GPU内核操作提高了约2000倍。

Conclusion: EpochCore通过创新的硬件设计，显著提升了SSMs的执行效率，为长序列任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中非凸奖励目标下Pareto稳定解的系统探索问题，填补理论空白。

Method: 结合加权切比雪夫（WC）和演员-评论家框架，设计MOCHA算法，通过选择学习率优化样本复杂度。

Result: MOCHA算法在样本复杂度上表现出对权重向量最小项的依赖，并在实验中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOCHA算法在多目标强化学习中具有高效的系统探索能力和理论保证。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

TL;DR: LIT-PCBA基准数据集存在严重的数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，导致其无法公平评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LIT-PCBA数据集在虚拟筛选基准测试中的缺陷，以促进更严谨的数据集开发。

Method: 通过审计数据集，识别数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，并设计一个基于记忆的基线模型验证问题。

Result: 发现大量数据重复和泄漏，基线模型仅通过记忆即可超越现有先进模型。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA不适合作为基准数据集，需开发更可靠的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNNs）在原生图结构中可能无法有效传递信息，尤其是在异质图和噪声图中表现不佳，因此需要开发图重连方法。

Method: 定义了一种干扰感知的扭矩度量，结合结构距离和能量分数，量化边引起的扰动，并通过修剪高扭矩边和添加低扭矩边来分层重构每层的感受野。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在异质图和同质图上均优于现有方法，并在噪声图上保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的扭矩驱动分层重连策略有效提升了GNNs在复杂图结构中的表现，增强了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中生成冗长的思维链序列会导致显著的内存开销，而中间推理步骤高度相似的现象为优化提供了机会。

Method: 提出MemShare方法，采用协同过滤算法识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用。

Result: 实验结果显示，MemShare在保持更高准确性的同时，吞吐量提升了84.79%。

Conclusion: MemShare通过高效的KV缓存管理，显著降低了内存开销并提升了性能，为大型推理模型的优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

Motivation: 解决物理信息神经网络在奇异摄动问题中难以收敛的局限性。

Method: PVD-Net采用两网络架构（稳定性优先）和五网络设计（高精度优先），PVD-ONet通过多个DeepONet模块扩展为算子学习框架。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在多种误差指标下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为多尺度问题提供了高效的新方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

TL;DR: RAGDP是一种无需额外训练的新框架，通过知识库加速预训练扩散策略的推理，提高准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略（DPs）在模仿学习中表现优异，但生成动作耗时；现有蒸馏方法（如CP）训练时间长。

Method: RAGDP利用DP编码器构建专家演示的向量数据库，推理时提取相似动作并结合噪声去除步骤减少生成步骤。

Result: RAGDP在20倍加速下仍保持准确性优势，比CP模型提高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP在无需额外训练的情况下优化了扩散策略的准确性与速度权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

Result: Latte在分布式设置中表现优异，且通信和计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte有效解决了分布式学习中的测试时适应问题，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable

Result: 模型能准确恢复底层流形结构，计算成本随数据长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该模型在合成数据和神经记录中验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a

This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上，DGP在可控的token预算内将欺诈检测性能提升至多6.8%（AUPRC）。

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLMs在欺诈检测中的潜力，有效解决了信息过载问题。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

*Hongwei Ma,Junbin Gao,Minh-Ngoc Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PREIG是一个新颖的深度学习框架，结合GRU和PINN原理，通过嵌入经济约束提升商品需求预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商品需求预测面临市场动态波动、非线性依赖和经济一致性要求等挑战，需要一种既能准确预测又能保持理论一致性的方法。

Method: PREIG整合GRU和PINN，通过定制损失函数嵌入价格与需求的负弹性约束，并采用NAdam、L-BFGS和POP的混合优化策略。

Result: PREIG在多个商品数据集上显著优于传统计量模型和深度学习基线（如ARIMA、GARCH、BPNN、RNN），在RMSE和MAPE上表现更优。

Conclusion: PREIG通过结合领域知识、优化理论和深度学习，为高维非线性时间序列预测提供了稳健、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氢氟烯烃因其极低的全球变暖潜能值成为下一代制冷剂的有力候选，但缺乏可靠的热力学数据阻碍了其发现与应用。

Method: 结合理论方法和数据驱动方法，设计了包含图神经网络模块的对应状态模型，通过已知流体的高精度数据训练模型，并采用留一法交叉验证评估。

Conclusion: 该模型通过嵌入物理知识提升了机器学习模型的性能，有望加速新型氢氟烯烃制冷剂的发现。

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性，理论上有保障。

Conclusion: ZS-PAG在零样本遗忘场景中表现优异，解决了过遗忘问题并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

Motivation: 逆合成规划在分子发现中仍是一个核心挑战，传统方法存在可扩展性差和泛化能力有限的问题，而无模板生成方法可能产生无效反应。

Method: TempRe将基于模板的方法重新表述为序列生成，支持单步和多步逆合成任务。

Result: 在PaRoutes多步基准测试中，TempRe表现出色，优于模板分类和SMILES生成方法。

Conclusion: 模板生成建模是计算机辅助合成规划中的一种强大范式。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

Motivation: 现有深度无线传感（DWS）模型多为黑盒，缺乏可解释性，限制了其通用性和安全性。

Method: 通过非平凡理论推导，将实值白盒Transformer扩展到复数域，并引入子空间正则化增强特征多样性。

Result: 在多个RF信号数据集上，RF-CRATE性能与黑盒模型相当，分类任务平均提升5.08%，回归误差降低10.34%。

Conclusion: RF-CRATE为RF传感提供了首个数学可解释的深度网络架构，性能优越且开源。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

Motivation: CCS技术对可持续未来至关重要，但优化其决策变量面临挑战，尤其是在高斯过程（GPs）表现不佳的情况下。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化框架，比较了高斯过程和其他新型随机模型，以优化CCS项目的决策变量，并以净现值（NPV）为目标函数。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化及其随机模型在CCS项目优化中具有潜力，为能源行业的可持续发展提供了新方法。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

Motivation: FNOs作为高维偏微分方程的替代模型，其稳定性、泛化性和频率行为缺乏理论解释，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用有效场论方法，推导了层核和四点顶点的闭合递推关系，并分析了三种重要设置：解析激活函数、尺度不变情况和残差连接架构。

Result: 理论表明非线性激活会耦合频率输入到高频模式，实验验证了频率转移现象；同时提出了权重初始化的临界条件，并通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 非线性使FNOs能捕捉非平凡特征，临界分析为超参数选择提供了标准，解释了尺度不变激活和残差连接如何增强FNOs的特征学习能力。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的物理现象学习提供了有效工具，适用于实际实验环境。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速策略如推测解码在小型和大型模型一致性低时效果有限，且未充分利用小型模型在生成简洁中间推理中的优势。

Method: R-Stitch默认使用SLM生成令牌，仅在SLM置信度低于阈值时调用LLM，避免全序列回滚并选择性使用LLM。

Result: 实验表明，R-Stitch在数学推理基准测试中实现了高达85%的延迟减少，且准确性下降可忽略。

Conclusion: R-Stitch是一种无需训练、模型无关且兼容标准解码流程的高效CoT推理加速方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

Motivation: 探索强化学习（RL）在LLMs后训练中的经济价值，填补这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出RLPF方法，利用历史广告表现数据作为奖励信号，训练模型AdLlama，并在Facebook广告平台上进行大规模A/B测试。

Result: AdLlama使点击率提升6.7%，广告主生成更多广告变体，满意度提高。

Conclusion: RLPF是一种有效且可推广的后训练方法，能够将语言模型能力转化为实际成果。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the

Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏是否能提升对抗样本的可迁移性，并提高黑盒攻击的效率。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet-161作为教师模型，通过课程切换和联合优化策略训练学生模型，生成对抗样本并进行评估。

Result: 学生模型生成的对抗样本攻击成功率与基线相当，生成时间减少6倍，低温和硬标签监督显著提升可迁移性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅能压缩模型，还能提升黑盒对抗攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Result: DRL在多种库存场景中表现优于或与现有基准相当，且参数调整需求少。

Conclusion: DRL成功填补了数据驱动学习与库存管理分析洞察之间的鸿沟，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Conclusion: 正交多项式基（如Legendre）在模型表达性和训练效率之间提供了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.
