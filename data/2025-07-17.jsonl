Manuscript submitted for review to the Journal of\n  Computational Literary Studies (JCLS)", "summary": "This study positions large language models (LLMs) as \"subjective literary\ncritics\" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary\nassessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into\nEnglish and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent\nsessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed\nsignificant variations in evaluation consistency ({\\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to\n0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance\nacross stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming\ndistinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session\nwithin-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically\nminimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped\nby RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that\nLLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human\ncritical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers."}

To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based\nsurrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study\ndeveloped a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U\nNet-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate\npredictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming\ntimesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model\ntemporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample\nmechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'\ncontact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements\nin computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN\nmodel was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot\nforming case study using aluminium alloys.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering).

To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation.

We attempt to reproduce and\nreconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and\nPavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between\nmodel-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic\nInterpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship\nbetween attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing\nhypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the\ndomain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that\nattention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression\nrather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can\nalso inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior\nis domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and\ncategory-sensitive patterns."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the\npotential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges\ndue to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of\ntraining data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both\napproaches and the importance of combining them."}

To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis\nof octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across\ncenturies and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema\ntheory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th\ncentury to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement\ntheir persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual\nmetaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies\nare applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text.

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness.

To evaluate\nthe proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug\nSMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in\nits own right.

In response to the high\nstochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party\nintegrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a\npolicy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The\nproposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance\nduring the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term\nmemory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and\nadopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning\nefficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces\nearly-stage training losses."}

In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code.

To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output.

A simple method to\napproximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the\nempirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As\nwe will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.\n  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using\nfeedback from a limited number of individuals.

Using this,\nit is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong\npredictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this\nnew tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and\narrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the\nactivation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise\nwhen the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic\npermutation-equivariant symmetry.

These findings\ncorroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended\ninductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of\notherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this\nsupports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations\nmay form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability\nphenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general\nlinear features and possibly Superposition.

To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples.

Existing studies have\nprimarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality\nimprovement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual\nanalytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML\nmodel performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that\nleverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques\ntackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format\nstandardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection.\nProcess-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by\nconsidering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness\nexpert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through\ncase studies, evaluations, and user studies."}

These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a\ndataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to\nrepresent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately\nrepresented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us\nto predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given\ndataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR.

This work performs a comprehensive\nempirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,\nleveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide\narray of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of\nembedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language\nmodels (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI\n(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,\nscientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).\nOur experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality\nsignificantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based\napproaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow\nalgorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived\nembeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in\ncross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid\nmodel evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical\napplications.

In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to\npredict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring\napproaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text\nclassifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple\nlinear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all\ntext-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or\nunsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,\nwhile model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive\nsignal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning\ncompletes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT\nsegments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety\nbenchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety\nmonitoring and early intervention during generation."}

In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale."}
