As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as\nmodel combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.\nAmong ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with\nvarious weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the\nexisting methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights\nconsider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various\ninformation that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information\nthrough cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,\nvarious types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be\nsimultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight\ndistribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were\napplied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble\nweighting methods.

However, the design of\njournalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance\nmultiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience's expected data literacy,\ntight publication deadlines, and the team's technical skills. Data journalists\noften come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and\ndata science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While\nprevious studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this\nresearch seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process\nemployed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific\nresearch questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do\neditorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we\ncollected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news\narticles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result,\nwe created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both\nproperties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features\nof maps.

A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework\nthat enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common\nhallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,\nA2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,\nsimplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical\ndimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs\nstep-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as\nMATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

But we\ndo not just follow rules and solve problems given to us by others: we modify\nthose rules, create new problems, and set new goals and tasks for ourselves and\nothers. Arguably, even more than rule following and problem solving, human\nintelligence is about creatively breaking and stretching the rules, changing\nthe game, and inventing new problems worth thinking about. Creating a good rule\nor a good problem depends not just on the ideas one can think up but on how one\nevaluates such proposals. Here, we study invention through the lens of game\ndesign. We focus particularly on the early stages of novice, \"everyday\" game\ncreation, where the stakes are low. We draw on a dataset of over 450 human\ncreated games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of\ntwo-player grid-based strategy games.

We systematically\nevaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies,\nincluding zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and\nChain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we\nconduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and\nclarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an\nLLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human\nevaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,\nand human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth\ndatasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,\nwith particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we\nintegrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type\ninformation.

To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently\noutperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,\n1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with\nmethods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal\nperformance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive\nembedding dimensions in CKGE.

We devise a\nspecialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning\nproblem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for\nrelevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes\nenvironmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages.

At the same time, even with the\nintroduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.\nIdeally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by\nthe presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents\nstruggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment\nfeedback.

We conducted an interview study with N=14 certified NVC\ntrainers and a diary study and co-design with N=13 lay users of online\ncommunication technologies to understand how NVC might inform design that\ncenters human relationships. We define three pillars of Needs-Conscious Design:\nIntentionality, Presence, and Receptiveness to Needs. Drawing on participant\nco-designs, we provide design concepts and illustrative examples for each of\nthese pillars.

Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for\nfiltering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,\nsimultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations\nremains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated\nindependently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions\nbetween items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework\nnamed FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks\nand graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue.

A graph attention mechanism dynamically\nweights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture\nof key interactions and generating precise representations for both user\npreferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT\noutperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in\nprecision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that\ncombining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph\nstructure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and\nefficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "FGAT\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u670d\u88c5\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u5c1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u5c1a\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u517c\u5bb9\u5546\u54c1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u670d\u88c5\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728POG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFGAT\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001HR\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001NDCG\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578bHFGN\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65f6\u5c1a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features.

A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments\non Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

While existing training-free\napproaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and\noverlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this\nwork, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel\nparadigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency\ndomain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the\nglobal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits\nsignificantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the\nlarger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the\nsuppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text.

However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency\nknowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world\ngraphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral\nspecificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between\npre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.\nUnder limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and\ndownstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose\nthe HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout\nboth pre-training and prompt-tuning.

Theoretical analysis, based\non a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied\nsub-linear regret bound.

In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an\nexplanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an\nexplanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of\nplausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular\nexplanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision\nfunctions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it\nshould be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which\ndifferent explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger\nthan what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and\ncounterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of\ndifferentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative\nwith respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss\nhow explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative.

A final Ridge Logistic Regression model\nachieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test\nset, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential\npredictors.

Recent work has introduced\nself-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving\nboth faithfulness and efficiency.

Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical\nrepresentation framework combines dimensionality reduction and\nmulti-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and\ncritical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation\nmodes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario\nquantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,\nagent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral\ncriticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming\na closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and\nexploration within the parameter space.

Conventional explainable\nartificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the\nupstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether\ninsights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds\nexplanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those\nexplanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,\nlearning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a\nsingle taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,\ndata analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;\nour survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in\ntheories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and\nfindings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that\nmake explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive\ntaxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and\nenabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further\ndemonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate\ndiverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into\nstakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and\ndomain experts.

By combining these innovations,\nSeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well\nsuited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SeamlessFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21RL\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6267\u884c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u5927\u5316GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21RL\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u8026\u5408\u3001GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u9762\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u9a71\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u590d\u7528\u7ba1\u9053\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u590d\u6742RL\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "SeamlessFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RL\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Given the complexity, scale,\nand long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual\nstakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether\ncollaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for\neffective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often\nimplemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features\nsuch as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive\nbehavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located\nin geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon\nextraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing\ninfrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and\nunrealistic.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively\ninvestigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of\nstakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our\napproach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety\nregulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2\ninto their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To\naddress the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity\nmodels, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control\n(E2C) framework is employed.
