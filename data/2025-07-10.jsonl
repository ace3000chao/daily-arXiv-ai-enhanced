Yet,\nvirtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including\nin studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the\nnew science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to\nkawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We\nconducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer\nvoices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii \"sweet\nspots\" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only\nfor certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling\neffect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation\nof the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for\nmanipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice."}

Currently, text\nvisualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can\nconvey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_,\nwhich convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the\nunderlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits\nthe kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be\ndisplayed.\n  In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested\ndecorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout.\nSpecifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or\n_rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly\nrendered even when styled with borders and padding.\n  We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite\ncomprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages,\nwe show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are\nsubstantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by\nconventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax\ntree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage\nscenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other\ndocument-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through\ndomain-specific styling of ragged blocks."}

We conducted a mixed-methods\nevaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters\npowered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These\nagents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,\nsemi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We\nanalyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,\nand learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization\ninfluenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural\nbackgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,\nand linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and\nstrategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally\nstylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing\nmore engaging, socially responsive systems."}

This study presents a\nnovel framework using insider language to contest conspiracy theory ideology in\nclimate change denialism on Reddit. Focusing on discussions in two Reddit\ncommunities, our research investigates reactions to pro-social and\nevidence-based intervention messages for two cohorts of users: climate change\ndeniers and climate change supporters. Specifically, we combine manual and\ngenerative AI-based methods to craft intervention messages and deploy the\ninterventions as replies on Reddit posts and comments through transparently\nlabeled bot accounts. On the one hand, we find that evidence-based\ninterventions with neutral language foster positive engagement, encouraging\nopen discussions among believers of climate change denialism. On the other,\nclimate change supporters respond positively, actively participating and\npresenting additional evidence. Our study contributes valuable insights into\nthe process and challenges of automatically delivering interventions in\nconspiracy theory communities on social media, and helps inform future research\non social media interventions."}

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of\nhigh-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings\noffer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and\noperations across the joint force."}

To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel parameter estimation method utilizing functional\napproximations with artificial neural networks.

In the first stage, the algorithm\nemploys a neural network to approximate the discontinuous signal with a smooth\nfunction. In the second stage, it uses this smooth approximate signal to\nestimate model parameters. HADES-NN gives highly accurate and precise parameter\nestimates across various applications, including circadian clock systems\nregulated by external light inputs measured via wearable devices and the mating\nresponse of yeast to external pheromone signals.

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations."}

Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a\nclosed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to\ndynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds\npromise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample\ncomplexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited\ndeployability on resource-constrained hardware.\n  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses\nthe core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation.

Together, these components improve sample efficiency,\nexploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained\nneuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic\nsimulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster\nconvergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and\nresilience to post-training FP16 quantization.

Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent\nfrom A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B\nsubstitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable\nperformance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity\nverification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy\nof 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model\ndelivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy."}

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of\nhigh-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings\noffer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and\noperations across the joint force."}

Yet,\nvirtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including\nin studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the\nnew science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to\nkawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We\nconducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer\nvoices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii \"sweet\nspots\" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only\nfor certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling\neffect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation\nof the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for\nmanipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice."}

Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including\nrecognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain\nunderserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge\nsuch gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning\nframework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.\nKnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic\nrepresentations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised\npre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively\nadapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed\ncondition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical\nprediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,\nremaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed\nexisting state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior\npredictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including\nAPACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in\nadapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific\ncharacteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data\nscenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings\nhighlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for\nsupporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in\nthe ICU."}

Temporal\nanalysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to\nevaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance\nstrategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as\nmanual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the\ncomplex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing\nrelevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,\nparticularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.\nIn this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded\ntopic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.\nA probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over\ntime. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the\npostponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals\nshifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to\nrecent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,\nfinance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,\nincluding preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word\ndistributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for\nanalyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the\nimplications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and\nrefinements to extend this approach to other policy domains."}

EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the\nprimary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,\nEEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)\nfactors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are\nbecoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly\nsusceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper\naddresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package\nto utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect\nsegments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained\nand evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15\nparticipants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid\noverall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens\nkappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in\nidentifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.\nAdditionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection\nusing another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and\ngenerating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental\nchallenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and\nrigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their\noutcomes."}

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations."}

However, its design and optimizations remain\ntailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when\napplied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major\nsource of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of\nvisual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy\nOptimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages\nthe model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal\nsupervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,\nexternal reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the\nImplicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO\nobjective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall\nimprovements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more\npronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also\nobserve a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating\nimproved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis\nof PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze\nand mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a\ndeeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning\nobjectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages\nvisually grounded reasoning.

While reinforcement learning (RL) holds\npromise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample\ncomplexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited\ndeployability on resource-constrained hardware.\n  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses\nthe core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation.

However, one major challenge for this\nparadigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across\nmultiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this\npaper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning\nparadigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during\nfederated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion\nrepresentations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel\ndiffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation\nCollaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion\nmodels to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven\ndiffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to\nprovide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence\nsignals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the\ndiffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive\nlearning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency\nregularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising\nrepresentations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In\naddition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying\non any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to\nensure convergence under non-convex objectives.

To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement.

As a result,\nsmall LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent\nperformance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has\nbeen previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in\ncommercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the\neffectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models\nand service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,\nwe demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target\ndomain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a\ncost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment."}

To address the need for adaptable\nand noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained\nlarge language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective\nsentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no\nfinetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining\nsupervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)\nclassifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance\ndespite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE\nevaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),\nmeasuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,\nand Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also\nrelease Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where\nonly KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show\nthat SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly\nreducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model\ncomplexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the\nadvantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and\nscalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications."}

Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of\n4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches\nper sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were\nconducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with\na fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a\ndetailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting\ntrade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the\npromise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting\nfuture work in non-autoregressive language generation."}
