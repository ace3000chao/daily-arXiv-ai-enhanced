In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive\napproach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals\nobtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older\nindividuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from\nthe Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were\nrecorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial\nExpression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion\ncategories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion\nrecognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without\nthe requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging\nclassical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional\nresponses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2\nscore with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has\nsignificant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related\nDementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical\nregression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for\nprivacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world\nsettings."}

Here, we offer an accessible\nsynthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while\nintegrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking\nabout machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures\nthat are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in\nseeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception\nof machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model\nforms \"features\" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the\nconnections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,\nstate-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual\nconnections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.\nThird, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a\ncollection of memorized facts and discovers a \"circuit\" that connects these\nfacts. However, we conclude by exploring the \"parallel mechanisms\" phenomenon,\narguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive\narchitecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from\nwhether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work."}

We introduce the\nDesign-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles\nrequirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph\nnodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS\ncollapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total\nof 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1\n70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON\nvalidity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,\nworkflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS\nmaintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage\nremained minimal (less than 20\\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\\% under\nspecific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\\% for MAS. Only the\nreasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by\nDeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)\nwhereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced\ndesign detail.

Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration.

Two primary\nstrategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on\nground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a\nlarger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear\ncomparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under\npractical conditions is needed.\n  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of\ndifferent sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a\nstrong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model\nsizes and architectures.

To address this, we\nsystematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and\nneural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.\nSpecifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages\nfrom four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and\nhigh-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their\ncorrelation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of\nevaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,\nn-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to\nisolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper\ntokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich\nfusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends.

AutoSlim uses Random Forest\nclassification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and\nstructural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while\npreserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated\nscore-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient\nranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in\nNAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,\nand resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs\nand over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of\nmagnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how\nhardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that\nAutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup."}

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work."}

In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive\napproach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals\nobtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older\nindividuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from\nthe Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were\nrecorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial\nExpression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion\ncategories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion\nrecognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without\nthe requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging\nclassical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional\nresponses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2\nscore with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has\nsignificant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related\nDementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical\nregression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for\nprivacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world\nsettings."}

Rather than\nlearning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the\nconsequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this\nwork, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many\ninstances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA\nfine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model\ntowards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task\nand in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising\ngeneralization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these\ntasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even\nfor a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model\nbackdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is\nsufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned\nduring fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs\ncan reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to\ntheir safe and reliable deployment."}

Over\nthe years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of\npain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various\nscientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of\ngender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain\nexperiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully\nclassified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute\nModel-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by\naggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic\ndifferences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally\nfocused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine\nand sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication\naffects individuals differently based on gender."}

However, a critical gap\npersists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability\nessential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nM2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial\nreasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data\npipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start\nfine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning\ntrajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic\nmulti-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts\nbetween data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive\nsignals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows\nM2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,\nshowcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains."}

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker\nattribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not\nbetter, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR\ntranscription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker\nidentity."}
