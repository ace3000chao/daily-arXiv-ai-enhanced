What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time.

An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies.

An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count).

To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

This paper introduces \\textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware\nco-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC\nacceleration. Firstly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity\nthrough an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd\ndimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and\nmemory parameters. Secondly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware\naccelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels\nwith a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,\nreconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular\naccess. Thirdly, the core of \\textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel\nsampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations.

This\nwork revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir\nGraph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a\nvariant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of\nsurface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification.

This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network\neffectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement\nspeeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal\ndependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors\nfor health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a\nsequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,\ncapturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.\nThis architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of\ninfrastructure health conditions.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.

Yet, the crucial task\nof out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We\npropose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and\nnaturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they\nhave shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle\nunder distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of\nTimeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.\nBuilding on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen\npatterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a\ndistinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the\nobserved context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and\nout-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block\nand pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for\nadaptable foundation imputation models."}
