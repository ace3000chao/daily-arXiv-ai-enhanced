However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned\nvariants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,\nRoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We\ndemonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks\nrelated to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph\nrepresentation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the\nlearned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context\nwe study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text\nanalysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and\nresearch."}

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems."}

Accurately modeling these processes is critical for\nregional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nto develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated\ninto a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be\ndifferentiable.

Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in\nnoisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates\nnoise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity\nand improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive\nAdjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label\ngeneration and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class\ndistributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully\nmanaging noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual\napproach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during\nlocal training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate\nFedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical\ndatasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,\nextreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise\nscenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving\nmodel stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for\nreal-world medical federated learning scenarios."}

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep\nlearning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective\nplayer and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.\nHowever, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of\ninteractions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling\nmatch dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous\nInteraction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep\nlearning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a\nmulti-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player\ndynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a\nPlayer Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through\nheterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a\nglobal graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which\nconstructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model\nhistorical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which\njointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match\noutcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a\nlarge-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly\noutperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide\nvaluable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation,\noffering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis."}

Evaluations on MIMIC-III\nand CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,\nF1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by\ncardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when\nplausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,\nwhich is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events\nare addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This\nwork underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems\n(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of\npatient narratives into actionable risk assessments."}

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation.

Extensive experiments\nacross the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and\nSAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents\nwithout our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up\nto 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost."}

However, most existing works\nassume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited\nunderstanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within\nthe model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in\nLLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a\nsingle model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed\nseveral triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding\nsimilarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation\neven when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings\nexpose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate\nthis threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains\nspecific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis.

Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique\nreference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited\nknowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.\nMoreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large\nlanguage model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts\npossess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in\nacademic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose\nleveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,\ne.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we\nextract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review\nreports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,\nwhich are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a\ntext-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human\nand LLM knowledge.

To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets.
