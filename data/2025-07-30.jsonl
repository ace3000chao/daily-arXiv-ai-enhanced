Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the\nprotocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of\nAI decision-making."}

We\nintroduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively\nevaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and\nclinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module.

However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality.

TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we\ntermed the Active Recall Probe.

We test\nTFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading\nregularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR\nperforms significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split\nCIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's\n7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume.

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,\nthe universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty\nlevels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku\npractitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles."}

While existing evaluation\nmethods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general\napproach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology\ncontent degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these\neffects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME\ncompares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The\nPile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral\nshifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics.

This\npaper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution\nshifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change\nbetween train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model\nexperiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of\nnovel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.\nFirst, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method\nfails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously\nperform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why\nhandling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of\nthe methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and\nmitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of\ndistribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions\nin this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in\nthe distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the\nexisting surveys."}

Despite the volumes that\nhave been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way\nto objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a\ngiven text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the\nuse of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to\nknow which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary\ngenres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to\ndevise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute\nArabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.\nA comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their\ndefinitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was\nconstructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on\nthe morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an\nanalogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's\nrhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.\nAdditionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices\nused across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created.

In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences\ninformation search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a\nGenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do\nlearners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an\nautoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to\nsupport orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was\ncounterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information\nsources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when\napplied to GenAI responses.

Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results.

In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition.

In this study, we propose RAGDP\n(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework\nthat eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to\nexpedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes\nobservation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database\nof expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is\nembedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted\naction is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number\nof steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by\nusing RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve\nthe accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when\naccelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,\nwith a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP."}

Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information\nto prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only\non LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,\ntext-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:\nmulti-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to\nrapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These\nneighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the\nprompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting\n(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual\ndetails for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into\ncoarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies\nfor different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields\nand statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective\ncompression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.\nExperiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates\nwithin a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by\nup to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of\nGraph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection."}

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are\nnecessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic\ninterpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the\nbroader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework."}

It is commonly\nbelieved to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather\nthan deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual\nknowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized\ndata. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the\nmodel first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a\nsemantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on\na small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8\nLLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the\nsemantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,\nsemantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising\nfinding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and\npossible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage."}

Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality.

Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism.

DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies\nfor different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields\nand statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective\ncompression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.\nExperiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates\nwithin a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by\nup to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of\nGraph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection."}

This study examines how students' AI literacy\nand prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,\nan interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on\nSelf-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze\nrelationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,\nand perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer\nScience and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial\nleast squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially\nself-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly\npredicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,\nin turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI\nexposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI\nliteracy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences.

A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the\nmodel's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change\nin the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the\nremaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable\nin a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available\n(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to\nfill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate\nthe inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)\nleveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform\nthe unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging\nzero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process\non the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling\nstrategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance\nafter unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and\nexperiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of\nour proposed method over several baselines."}

In this work, inspired by\nthe remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the\nfirst mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,\ngrounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the\nunique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend\nthe original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By\nleveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully\ncomplex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention\nand residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the\nmodel's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,\nwe introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that\nenhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of\n19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against\nseven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving\ndifferent RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on\npar with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full\nmathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the\ncomplex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average\nclassification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across\ndiverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nLLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed\nfrom historical trajectories to augment current task planning.
