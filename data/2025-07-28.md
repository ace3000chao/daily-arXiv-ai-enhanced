### [1] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSC框架通过多步推理让语言模型自我修正有缺陷的指导规范，显著减少模型对规范的滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易利用有缺陷的规范（如评分标准）获得高分，而忽略用户真实意图。

Method: SSC框架通过生成、批判和修正规范的多步推理过程，动态修复规范漏洞。

Result: 实验表明，SSC将模型滥用规范的比例从50-70%降低至90%以下。

Conclusion: SSC无需修改模型权重，即可在推理时动态提升模型行为的鲁棒性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

### [2] [The Role of Orthographic Consistency in Multilingual Embedding Models for Text Classification in Arabic-Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18762)
*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AS-RoBERTa模型针对阿拉伯语系语言（如库尔德语、阿拉伯语、波斯语和乌尔都语）进行专门预训练，显著优于通用多语言模型mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言模型在共享脚本但文化和正字法差异大的语言（如阿拉伯语系语言）中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 开发了四种基于RoBERTa的AS-RoBERTa模型，每种针对特定语言进行预训练，专注于脚本特征和统计信息。

Result: AS-RoBERTa在分类任务中比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa表现优2-5个百分点，脚本专注预训练是关键。

Conclusion: 脚本感知的专门化对阿拉伯语系语言有重要价值，支持基于脚本和语言特性的预训练策略。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

*Nicole Lai-Lopez,Lusha Wang,Su Yuan,Liza Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种多语言文本去毒方法，结合词典引导标注、微调序列到序列模型和迭代分类器门控机制，在PAN-2025竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言文本去毒任务，提升去毒精度和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 整合词典引导标注、微调序列到序列模型（s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo）和迭代分类器门控机制。

Result: 模型在STA（0.922）和J分数（0.612）上表现最佳，xCOMET分数分别为0.793（开发集）和0.787（测试集）。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言环境中优于基线方法，展现了强泛化能力，但在SIM指标上有所牺牲。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

### [4] [Evaluating Code-Mixing in LLMs Across 18 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18791)
*Yilun Yang,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代码混合（多语言混用）对自然语言处理的挑战，指出现有基准的局限性，并提出了一种新的合成代码混合文本的方法。研究发现大型语言模型在多语言混合任务中表现不佳，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合在多语言用户中很常见，但现有基准和大型语言模型的研究有限，且数据生成方法不成熟。

Method: 对18种语言的代码混合数据进行了全面评估，并提出了一种结合单词替换和GPT-4提示的合成代码混合文本方法。

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型在涉及多语言家族的代码混合数据上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 建议通过增加训练数据规模、模型规模和少样本学习来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

### [5] [CueBuddy: helping non-native English speakers navigate English-centric STEM education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18827)
*Pranav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CueBuddy 通过实时技术关键词识别和多语言术语查找，帮助非英语母语的 STEM 学生理解复杂英语术语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM 课程中，非英语母语学生因英语术语困难而落后于英语流利的同学，尽管科学基础相当。

Method: 开发 CueBuddy，提供实时“词汇提示”，包括技术关键词识别和多语言术语查找。

Result: CueBuddy 帮助学生跟上复杂英语术语，同时不干扰课堂注意力。

Conclusion: CueBuddy 是一种有前景的解决方案，但仍存在局限性，未来可进一步扩展。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrismRAG提出了一种高效的微调框架，通过训练模型处理包含干扰信息的QA对，并培养推理习惯，显著提升了RAG的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在检索到半相关或干扰性上下文时表现不佳，且缺乏深度推理能力。

Method: PrismRAG通过训练模型处理含干扰信息的QA对，并培养其规划、推理和综合能力。

Result: 在12个开放书RAG QA基准测试中，PrismRAG平均事实准确性提升5.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PrismRAG通过改进训练和推理能力，显著提升了RAG的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

### [7] [MindFlow+: A Self-Evolving Agent for E-Commerce Customer Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18884)
*Ming Gong,Xucheng Huang,Ziheng Xu,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindFlow+结合大语言模型、模仿学习和离线强化学习，通过工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模，提升电商对话系统的上下文相关性和任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于意图的对话系统难以应对动态多轮交互，需要更灵活、领域专用的解决方案。

Method: 结合大语言模型、模仿学习和离线强化学习，引入工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模机制。

Result: 在真实电商对话中，MindFlow+在上下文相关性、灵活性和任务准确性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合大语言模型、工具推理和奖励引导学习，可构建领域专用、上下文感知的对话系统。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### [8] [NUTMEG: Separating Signal From Noise in Annotator Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18890)
*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG是一种贝叶斯模型，通过考虑标注者背景信息，从人类标注数据中去除噪声，同时保留系统性分歧，优于传统聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设标注分歧是错误，但实际可能是真实分歧，需区分信号与噪声。

Method: 提出NUTMEG模型，利用标注者背景信息去除噪声，保留系统性分歧。

Result: 在合成数据上，NUTMEG比传统方法更有效恢复真实标注；下游模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 标注者能力和系统性分歧均需考虑，NUTMEG为此提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

### [9] [REPRO-Bench: Can Agentic AI Systems Assess the Reproducibility of Social Science Research?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18901)
*Chuxuan Hu,Liyun Zhang,Yeji Lim,Aum Wadhwani,Austin Peters,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了REPRO-Bench，一个用于评估AI代理自动化社会科学论文可重复性的基准测试，解决了现有基准的不足，并开发了改进的REPRO-Agent。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理自动化社会科学论文可重复性评估的能力，以解决现有基准的局限性。

Method: 引入REPRO-Bench，包含112个任务实例，每个实例代表一篇社会科学论文及其公开的复制报告。评估三种AI代理的性能，并开发改进的REPRO-Agent。

Result: 最佳AI代理在REPRO-Bench上的准确率仅为21.4%，而REPRO-Agent将准确率提高了71%。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的AI代理以自动化真实世界的可重复性评估。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

### [10] [SLoW: Select Low-frequency Words! Automatic Dictionary Selection for Translation on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18902)
*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADS的任务，通过选择低频词典来优化翻译性能与token消耗的平衡，方法名为SLoW，无需训练数据且效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs仅支持数百种语言，而全球有7000多种语言，词典提示方法虽能增强翻译，但全量使用词典成本高，需灵活权衡性能与消耗。

Method: 提出SLoW方法，自动选择低频词典，无需训练数据，直接利用公共资源估计词频。

Result: 在FLORES的100种语言上，SLoW超越基线方法，显著节省token且翻译性能优于全量词典。

Conclusion: SLoW方法高效且实用，无需训练数据即可提升翻译性能，为多语言翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种公开可用的医疗聊天机器人的安全性，发现其回答中存在显著差异，部分回答可能导致严重患者伤害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估公开聊天机器人在医疗建议中的安全性，以解决患者安全问题。

Method: 使用新数据集HealthAdvice，对222个医疗问题生成888个回答，进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 问题回答率从21.6%（Claude）到43.2%（Llama），不安全回答率从5%（Claude）到13%（GPT-4o, Llama）。

Conclusion: 数百万患者可能从公开聊天机器人处获得不安全医疗建议，需进一步改进临床安全性。

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种从无标签数据集中挖掘图像视觉元素关联的方法，生成高质量创意标题，并构建了一个包含170万创意标题的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖简短、字面的网络数据，缺乏对创意输出的理解。

Method: 从图像中挖掘上下文关联，生成不同抽象程度的创意标题。

Result: 构建了MSCOCO图像的创意标题数据集，提升了零样本图像-文本检索在诗歌和隐喻可视化领域的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的标题既视觉相关又具抽象性，为创意领域提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

*Richmond Sin Jing Xuan,Jalil Huseynov,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，通过激活模式分析和LoRA微调，显著提升了低资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究多语言大模型在低资源语言上表现不佳的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析激活模式，并通过LoRA进行激活感知微调。

Result: 低资源语言的激活显著提升（如马拉雅拉姆语87.69%），同时保持英语性能（约91%）。

Conclusion: 激活对齐是提升多语言大模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

*Jingxuan Wei,Caijun Jia,Qi Chen,Yujun Cai,Linzhuang Sun,Xiangxiang Zhang,Gaowei Wu,Bihui Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaVA-NeuMT是一种新型多模态多语言翻译框架，通过显式建模语言特定和语言无关表示来减少多语言干扰，实验表明其在仅微调40%参数的情况下优于全微调方法，并在两个数据集上达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMT方法在双语场景表现良好，但在多语言翻译中面临跨语言干扰和参数共享策略无效的挑战。

Method: 提出LLaVA-NeuMT框架，包括层选择机制和神经元级适应策略，动态选择语言特定和无关神经元。

Result: 在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上，LLaVA-NeuMT仅微调40%参数即超越全微调方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT为多模态多语言翻译提供了一种高效且可扩展的跨语言适应解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying
patterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate
the crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal
professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

*Sang Min Jung,Kaixiang Zhang,Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于比较对话动态的相似性度量方法，并验证其鲁棒性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法全面比较对话的整体交互动态，影响了对话数据的分析和对话代理的评估。

Method: 设计了一种相似性度量方法，并开发了验证框架测试其鲁棒性和对话题的敏感性。

Result: 该方法成功应用于大型在线社区对话分析，揭示了情境权力在对话中的作用。

Conclusion: 提出的相似性度量方法为对话动态分析提供了新工具，有助于更全面地评估对话质量。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG是一个多工具聚合框架，通过并发调用多个工具增强LLM的数学推理能力，无需微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法在复杂数学问题上表现不佳，需要多步精确推理。

Method: Multi-TAG框架在推理步骤中并发调用多个工具，聚合输出以验证和优化推理过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Multi-TAG平均提升6.0%至7.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG为复杂数学推理提供了一种高效、无需微调的解决方案。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辩论摘要生成阶段缺乏对事实修正和结构优化的支持，现有方法多为单次生成。

Method: 结合掩码控制器和充分性检查模块，通过迭代掩码和再生改进摘要。

Result: 在10个自动评估指标中7个优于基线，人工评估在覆盖性、忠实性和简洁性上显著提升。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA的迭代生成策略有效提升了辩论摘要的质量。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

Motivation: 现有单LLM方法在复杂声明验证中表现不佳，受现实世界事实核查实践启发，提出辩论驱动方法。

Method: 采用多LLM代理框架，包括两个辩论者和一个仲裁者，通过多轮辩论和合成数据训练提升仲裁者性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同证据质量下均优于现有声明验证方法。

Conclusion: DebateCV通过辩论驱动和合成数据训练，有效解决了复杂声明验证问题。

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DebateCV-6781.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于用户研究的主题质量评估方法，关注用户如何解释主题，并提出了基于认知偏差的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题质量评估方法（如一致性和词入侵）未能衡量主题对语料库探索的促进作用，因此需要基于任务和用户群体的评估方法。

Method: 通过用户研究，让用户在主题背景下评估主题质量并提供理由，使用反思性主题分析从理由中识别主题解释模式。

Result: 用户基于可用性和代表性启发式解释主题，而非概率；提出了基于锚定-调整启发式的主题解释理论。

Conclusion: 主题解释可视为生态理性用户在不确定性下的判断，需开发认知偏差感知的用户模型和评估框架。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成内容时如何延续性别和职业偏见，尤其是在意大利语中。实验发现，LLMs如ChatGPT和Gemini在回答无性别提示时表现出明显偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其可能延续社会偏见的问题引发担忧，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 通过结构化实验方法，分析两种LLM（ChatGPT和Gemini）对无性别提示的响应，收集3600条数据。

Result: 结果显示LLMs显著延续性别和职业偏见，例如Gemini将100%的“她”代词与“助理”而非“经理”关联。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发缓解策略以确保AI系统不加剧社会不平等，未来可扩展研究至更多语言或模型。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在数据中毒和方言差异（如AAVE与SAE）的共同作用下，会放大毒性输出，尤其是对AAVE输入的毒性反应更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨方言差异（AAVE与SAE）和数据中毒如何共同影响LLM的毒性输出，揭示模型规模与偏见放大的关系。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLaMA模型，结合数据中毒实验，并通过GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具分析输出。

Result: 数据中毒显著增加AAVE输入的毒性，而SAE受影响较小；模型规模越大，偏见放大效应越明显。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发方言感知的评估方法、针对性去偏干预措施及社会责任导向的训练协议。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法同时保证可重复性、透明性和高效性，且LLM的高估程度未被量化。

Method: 提出ArxivRoll框架，包含SCP（自动生成私有测试用例）和Rugged Scores（量化污染和训练偏差）。

Result: 实验证明基准质量高，并对当前LLM进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll有效解决了LLM评估中的高估问题，提升了评估的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Motivation: 揭示LLDMs的安全漏洞，现有攻击方法对其无效，需开发新攻击方法以评估其安全性。

Method: 提出PAD攻击方法，利用Multi-Point Attention Attack引导并行生成过程产生有害输出。

Result: PAD在四种LLDMs上攻击成功率达97%，有害生成速度是同类LLMs的2倍。

Conclusion: LLDMs存在显著安全风险，需进一步研究其架构以确保安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在理解复杂社会科学概念（如民粹主义）方面的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 方法包括构建专门的数据集，评估多种预训练和指令调优的LLMs，并进行跨领域测试。

Result: 结果显示微调的RoBERTa模型表现最佳，而指令调优的LLMs在跨领域数据上更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs在民粹主义分析中存在局限性，但微调模型和跨领域测试提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: AutoPCR具有归纳能力和对新本体的泛化能力。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环大语言模型由于固定大小的内存限制，在长上下文任务中表现不佳。传统方法通过架构创新增强内存容量，但未能使其性能与自注意力模型相当。

Method: 提出Smooth Reading，一种分块推理方法，模拟人类阅读策略，分块处理上下文并迭代总结信息，减少内存需求。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著提升了循环模型的性能，甚至在某些任务中超越自注意力模型，同时训练和推理速度更快。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading首次实现了循环模型在长上下文任务中与自注意力模型相当的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

Motivation: 解决ASR转录与说话人分割输出之间的时间戳不对齐问题，以提高多模态情感识别的可靠性。

Method: 使用预训练的ASR和说话人分割模型，同步时间戳生成准确标记的说话人片段，结合RoBERTa和Wav2Vec嵌入，采用门控机制的跨注意力融合。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上实验显示，时间戳对齐显著提升情感识别准确率，优于未同步的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间戳对齐对多模态情感识别至关重要，为鲁棒的情感分析提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全自动方法生成带有语法错误和不流畅性的音频-文本对，并设计了一系列客观指标评估生成数据，以选择更适合口语语法纠错（SGEC）的数据集。目标是生成增强数据集，保持原始数据的文本和声学特征，同时提供新类型的错误，且不改变第二语言学习者的语言评估分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的口语语法纠错（SGEC）标注数据集稀缺，现有基准数据集主要针对书面语法纠错（GEC）。

Method: 提出全自动方法生成音频-文本对，并设计客观指标评估数据质量。

Result: 在S&I语料库上进行实验，验证了增强数据集在书面GEC和SGEC任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 增强数据集能丰富原始语料库，同时保持语言评估分数的稳定性，适用于SGEC任务。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Motivation: 为临床自由文本中的ADE检测提供基准，评估不同模型性能，并强调适合任务需求的性能指标。

Method: 使用Bi-LSTM和四种Transformer模型（BERTje、RobBERT、MedRoBERTa.nl、NuNER）进行命名实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC），基于102份荷兰ICU临床记录。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl在ADE RC任务中表现最佳，宏平均F1得分为0.63（黄金标准）和0.62（预测实体），外部验证召回率为0.67-0.74。

Conclusion: 研究提供了ADE检测的稳健方法，强调了适合临床任务的性能指标的重要性，并为未来临床应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学文本嵌入模型存在数据覆盖窄、方法过时以及评估不足的问题，无法满足实际医疗任务的多样性需求。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习方法在多源医学数据上微调GTE模型（MEDTE），并设计了一个包含51个任务的医学文本评估基准。

Result: MEDTE模型在多种任务中表现优于现有方法，同时提出的评估基准为医学文本嵌入提供了更全面的测试框架。

Conclusion: 通过MEDTE模型和全面的评估基准，论文解决了医学文本嵌入的局限性，为医疗应用提供了更可靠的嵌入方法。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

TL;DR: GEPA是一种基于自然语言反思的提示优化器，通过少量试验即可显著提升任务性能，优于GRPO和MIPROv2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法（如GRPO）需要大量试验，而语言的可解释性可能为LLMs提供更丰富的学习媒介。

Method: GEPA通过自然语言反思诊断问题、提出提示更新，并结合Pareto前沿的互补经验。

Result: 在四项任务中，GEPA平均性能优于GRPO 10%，最高达20%，且试验次数减少35倍。

Conclusion: GEPA展示了在少量试验下高效优化提示的潜力，适用于代码优化等任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务组合在构建自适应和智能软件系统中面临挑战，现有方法在推理和执行方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出集成LRM和LAM的架构框架，LRM负责语义推理，LAM负责动态执行。

Result: 该框架能够自动化服务组合，通过自然语言意图驱动，实现从意图到执行的闭环。

Conclusion: LRM-LAM集成框架为自动化服务组合提供了有前景的方向，有望提升系统的智能性和用户友好性。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强的Dyna-DDPG和良好的软件工程实践，实现了高效、可复现和可维护的解决方案。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决AI系统在组合泛化上的核心挑战，模拟人脑海马体与前额叶皮层的协作机制。

Method: MIRAGE包含两个模块：元训练的Transformer Neural Decomposer（类似新皮层模式识别）和Schema Engine（类似HPC-PFC循环），通过动态提取和应用可重用模式实现泛化。

Result: 在SCAN基准测试中，MIRAGE达到>99%准确率，仅需1.19M参数。消融实验证实其系统性依赖于模式质量和迭代优化。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过显式管理模式结构和迭代优化，实现了系统性组合泛化，为AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

Result: 策略性能接近全状态基线，仅需原始状态的三分之一到三分之二，且能适应机器人属性变化。

Conclusion: 历史编码器通过重构上下文信息实现鲁棒决策，为部分可观测性下的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

Motivation: 传统TKG完成模型假设训练时可访问整个图谱，忽视了图谱动态变化带来的挑战，如新知识的泛化和稀疏连接实体的管理。

Method: 结合模型无关的增强层和加权采样策略，增强层利用全局实体相似性定义，采样策略侧重稀疏实体。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解灾难性遗忘，增强了TKG完成模型的鲁棒性，特别适用于增量训练场景。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

Conclusion: FRTI任务和RoadDiff框架为精确交通管理提供了更高效和经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

Result: 在MO-TSPTW和神经架构搜索任务中表现优异，优于现有多目标进化算法。

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA是NRPA首次成功应用于多目标优化，具有竞争力和潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

Conclusion: OS-MAP为计算机代理的研究和部署提供了结构化评估框架，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

Conclusion: PhysDrive将成为多模态驾驶员监测和智能座舱系统研究的基础资源。

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit

### [46] [Faster Lifting for Ordered Domains with Predecessor Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19182)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理前驱关系时效率低下，尤其是在涉及前驱关系时，现有算法难以应对实际应用需求。

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

*Osama Almurshed,Ashish Kaushal,Asmail Muftah,Nitin Auluck,Omer Rana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出知识嫁接方法，通过将大模型的特征移植到小模型上，显著减小模型体积并提升性能，适用于资源受限场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在资源受限环境中部署的挑战，平衡模型大小与性能。

Method: 引入知识嫁接机制，将大模型（供体）的特征移植到小模型（砧木）上。

Result: 模型体积减少88.54%，验证准确率提升至89.97%，泛化能力增强。

Conclusion: 知识嫁接方法有效解决了资源受限场景下的AI部署问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在隐藏棋子身份游戏中表示信念的两种方法：基于约束的模型和概率扩展模型，发现两者效果相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完全信息游戏中代理需基于部分知识决策的问题，减少游戏特定推理逻辑的需求。

Method: 采用基于约束的模型（CSP）和概率扩展模型（信念传播）表示信念，并在两种游戏中评估效果。

Result: 两种表示方法对代理性能影响相近，约束模型效果与概率推理相当。

Conclusion: 约束模型在许多场景下可能足以支持有效决策。

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Conclusion: 提出的系统在性能上超越了多个强基线模型，包括专用算法模型和通用大语言模型。

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了基础设施规划中的复杂性和可扩展性问题，为实际应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

Conclusion: 研究为视觉任务中的专业知识获取提供见解，有助于设计AI辅助学习干预。

Abstract: Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial
for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis
methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This
study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning
outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental
radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to
model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network
metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify
distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association
with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network
metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores,
while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively
correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual
students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to
expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise
acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning
interventions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现，与人类相比，与大型语言模型（LLM）互动时合作率略低（低10-15%），但整体仍较高。沟通能提升合作率，但对人类和LLM效果相同。LLM的合作行为受先前人类互动影响。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨LLM在商业合作场景中如何影响人类行为，验证其潜在应用价值。

Method: 通过囚徒困境实验（重复和单次游戏），比较人类与LLM、经典机器人的合作行为，并测试沟通的作用。

Result: LLM的合作率低于人类但较高；沟通提升合作率（+88%）；人类互动对LLM合作行为有溢出效应。

Conclusion: LLM在合作场景中可谨慎应用，沟通和人类互动能优化其效果。

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment
humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for
business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder
trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

Method: 通过在线游戏收集数据，参与者对随机展示的真实和AI生成图像进行识别。

Result: 整体识别成功率为62%，人像识别最准确，自然和城市景观识别较差。

Conclusion: 人类难以区分AI生成图像，需透明工具（如水印和AI检测工具）以减少误导风险。

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content

Method: 通过重现Ernie Bushmiller的三格漫画任务，分别让人类参与者（有基础艺术训练的学生）和商业AI模型完成，比较其结果。

Result: AI在模仿专业艺术上表现优异，但在构建连贯视觉故事上表现不佳；人类则能有效将指令转化为有意义的故事。

Conclusion: 人类在视觉叙事任务中更具优势，而AI目前仍局限于模仿艺术风格，缺乏叙事连贯性。

Abstract: This article presents a case study comparing the capabilities of humans and
artificial intelligence (AI) for visual storytelling. We developed detailed
instructions to recreate a three-panel Nancy cartoon strip by Ernie Bushmiller
and provided them to both humans and AI systems. The human participants were
20-something students with basic artistic training but no experience or
knowledge of this comic strip. The AI systems used were popular commercial
models trained to draw and paint like artists, though their training sets may
not necessarily include Bushmiller's work. Results showed that AI systems excel
at mimicking professional art but struggle to create coherent visual stories.
In contrast, humans proved highly adept at transforming instructions into
meaningful visual narratives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用户界面要求标注者比较长文本段落，这在文本较长或不熟悉时具有认知挑战性，因此需要改进人类反馈的质量。

Method: 采用分解原则，将文本分解为单个声明，开发了DxHF用户界面，通过视觉编码和链接相似声明来优化比较过程。

Result: 技术评估显示分解提高了反馈准确性，特别是在用户不确定时；众包研究表明DxHF平均提高准确性5%，但反馈时间增加18秒。

Conclusion: 分解原则和DxHF界面显著提升了人类反馈质量，尤其在用户不确定时，展示了HCI在改进人机对齐中的潜力。

Abstract: Human preferences are widely used to align large language models (LLMs)
through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
However, the current user interfaces require annotators to compare text
paragraphs, which is cognitively challenging when the texts are long or
unfamiliar. This paper contributes by studying the decomposition principle as
an approach to improving the quality of human feedback for LLM alignment. This
approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly
comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a
novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing
decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the
conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key
information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment. Our
technical evaluation shows evidence that decomposition generally improves
feedback accuracy regarding the ground truth, particularly for users with
uncertainty. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants indicates that using
DxHF improves feedback accuracy by an average of 5%, although it increases the
average feedback time by 18 seconds. Notably, accuracy is significantly higher
in situations where users have less certainty. The finding of the study
highlights the potential of HCI as an effective method for improving human-AI
alignment.

Motivation: 自动驾驶决策中的不确定性通常未传达给行人，影响透明性，研究旨在探索如何有效传达不确定性。

Method: 采用VR实验（N=26），比较显式（百分比显示）和隐式（车辆运动提示）两种方式在不同置信水平下的效果。

Result: 显式沟通更有效，提升安全感和信任；隐式方式在低置信度时易引发歧义。

Conclusion: 研究为AV外部界面设计提供指导，建议整合显式不确定性传达以优化行人体验。

Abstract: Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of autonomous vehicle (AV) decision-making,
yet it is rarely communicated to pedestrians, which hinders transparency. This
study investigates how AV uncertainty can be conveyed through two approaches:
explicit communication (confidence percentage displays) and implicit
communication (vehicle motion cues), across different confidence levels (high
and low). Through a within-subject VR experiment (N=26), we evaluated these
approaches in a crossing scenario, assessing interface qualities (visibility
and intuitiveness), how well the information conveyed the vehicle's level of
confidence, and their impact on participants' perceived safety, trust, and user
experience. Our results show that explicit communication is more effective and
preferred for conveying uncertainty, enhancing safety, trust, and user
experience. Conversely, implicit communication introduces ambiguity, especially
when AV confidence is low. This research provides empirical insights into how
uncertainty communication shapes pedestrian interpretation of AV behaviour and
offer design guidance for external interfaces that integrate uncertainty as a
communicative element.

approaches: in the first, participants built their own low-fidelity prototypes;
in the second, they evaluated and discussed the initial prototypes we provided.
We will outline how each workshop was set up and share lessons learned about
prototyping methods for BVIPs and how they could be improved.

### [63] [Limits at a Distance: Design Directions to Address Psychological Distance in Policy Decisions Affecting Planetary Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18913)
*Eshta Bhardwaj,Han Qiao,Christoph Becker*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了心理距离对气候政策决策中数据可视化的影响，提出结合情感设计方法以改善决策者的认知和决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据可视化方法假设决策者是理性且客观的，但忽视了心理距离（如时空、社会身份等）对决策的影响。气候政策亟需更有效的设计实践。

Method: 通过文献综述和综合，将心理距离理论与推测性设计和数据情感化结合，分析情感设计方法的价值。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的环境数据沟通和可视化前提，强调情感设计可以减少心理距离的影响。

Conclusion: 未来研究应探索替代设计方法对心理距离的影响，使政策数据更直观和情感化。

Abstract: Policy decisions relevant to the environment rely on tools like dashboards,
risk models, and prediction models to provide information and data
visualizations that enable decision-makers to make trade-offs. The conventional
paradigm of data visualization practices for policy and decision-making is to
convey data in a supposedly neutral, objective manner for rational
decision-makers. Feminist critique advocates for nuanced and reflexive
approaches that take into account situated decision-makers and their affective
relationships to data. This paper sheds light on a key cognitive aspect that
impacts how decision-makers interpret data. Because all outcomes from policies
relevant to climate change occur at a distance, decision-makers experience
so-called `psychological distance' to environmental decisions in terms of
space, time, social identity, and hypotheticality. This profoundly impacts how
they perceive and evaluate outcomes. Since policy decisions to achieve a safe
planetary space are urgently needed for immediate transition and change, we
need a design practice that takes into account how psychological distance
affects cognition and decision-making. Our paper explores the role of
alternative design approaches in developing visualizations used for climate
policymaking. We conduct a literature review and synthesis which bridges
psychological distance with speculative design and data visceralization by
illustrating the value of affective design methods via examples from previous
research. Through this work, we propose a novel premise for the communication
and visualization of environmental data. Our paper lays out how future research
on the impacts of alternative design approaches on psychological distance can
make data used for policy decisions more tangible and visceral.

TL;DR: TreeReader是一种新型的论文阅读工具，通过将论文分解为交互式树状结构并提供LLM生成的摘要，帮助用户高效导航和理解学术文献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性格式（如PDF和HTML）可能导致认知过载并掩盖论文的层次结构，而现有的LLM摘要工具缺乏对特定部分的细致理解且不可靠。

Method: TreeReader将论文分解为树状结构，每个部分由LLM生成简洁摘要，用户可按需查看详细信息。

Result: 用户研究表明，TreeReader显著提高了阅读效率和理解能力。

Conclusion: TreeReader通过结合层次化摘要和交互式探索，为学术文献的导航和理解提供了更高效的方式。

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DataScout是一个用于数据集搜索的工具，通过AI辅助查询重构、语义搜索和动态相关性指标，帮助用户更高效地发现适合任务的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据集搜索界面限制用户表达隐式偏好，且缺乏对搜索空间和结果包含标准的透明度，导致查询迭代困难。

Method: DataScout通过AI辅助查询重构、基于数据集内容的语义搜索和过滤，以及动态生成的数据集相关性指标来改进搜索过程。

Result: 用户研究表明，DataScout不仅支持结构化探索，还能帮助用户获取查询反馈并构建搜索空间的概念模型。

Conclusion: DataScout通过多维度支持显著提升了数据集搜索的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Dataset Search -- the process of finding appropriate datasets for a given
task -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge in data science
workflows. Assessing dataset suitability for a task (e.g., training a
classification model) is a multi-pronged affair that involves understanding:
data characteristics (e.g. granularity, attributes, size), semantics (e.g.,
data semantics, creation goals), and relevance to the task at hand. Present-day
dataset search interfaces are restrictive -- users struggle to convey implicit
preferences and lack visibility into the search space and result inclusion
criteria -- making query iteration challenging. To bridge these gaps, we
introduce DataScout to proactively steer users through the process of dataset
discovery via -- (i) AI-assisted query reformulations informed by the
underlying search space, (ii) semantic search and filtering based on dataset
content, including attributes (columns) and granularity (rows), and (iii)
dataset relevance indicators, generated dynamically based on the user-specified
task. A within-subjects study with 12 participants comparing DataScout to
keyword and semantic dataset search reveals that users uniquely employ
DataScout's features not only for structured explorations, but also to glean
feedback on their search queries and build conceptual models of the search
space.

*Chang Chen,Sicheng Song,Shuchang Xu,Zhicheng Li,Huamin Qu,Yanna Lin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: RhythmTA是一个帮助ESL学习者独立练习英语语音节奏的交互式系统，通过配音练习提升节奏感知和发音能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESL学习者缺乏独立练习语音节奏的工具，依赖外部反馈。RhythmTA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 系统自动提取语音节奏，通过视觉设计支持配音练习的三个阶段：同步听、引导重复和比较反思。

Result: 用户研究表明，RhythmTA有效提升学习者的节奏感知，并有望改善发音。

Conclusion: RhythmTA为ESL学习者提供了一种独立练习语音节奏的有效方法。

Abstract: English speech rhythm, the temporal patterns of stressed syllables, is
essential for English as a second language (ESL) learners to produce
natural-sounding and comprehensible speech. Rhythm training is generally based
on imitation of native speech. However, it relies heavily on external
instructor feedback, preventing ESL learners from independent practice. To
address this gap, we present RhythmTA, an interactive system for ESL learners
to practice speech rhythm independently via dubbing, an imitation-based
approach. The system automatically extracts rhythm from any English speech and
introduces novel visual designs to support three stages of dubbing practice:
(1) Synchronized listening with visual aids to enhance perception, (2) Guided
repeating by visual cues for self-adjustment, and (3) Comparative reflection
from a parallel view for self-monitoring. Our design is informed by a formative
study with nine spoken English instructors, which identified current practices
and challenges. A user study with twelve ESL learners demonstrates that
RhythmTA effectively enhances learners' rhythm perception and shows significant
potential for improving rhythm production.

Abstract: What could designing for carbon reduction of heating and cooling in
commercial settings look like in the near future? How can we challenge dominant
mindsets and paradigms of efficiency and behaviour change? How can we help
build worlds through our practice that can become future realities? This paper
introduces the fictional consultancy ANCSTRL.LAB to explore opportunities for
making space in research projects that can encourage more systems-oriented
interventions. We present a design fiction that asks `what if energy management
and reduction practice embraced systems thinking?'. Our design fiction explores
how future energy consultancies could utilise systems thinking, and (more than)
human centred design to re-imagine energy management practice and change
systems in ways that are currently unfathomable. We finish by discussing how
LIMITS research can utilise design fiction and speculative praxis to help build
new material realities where more holistic perspectives, the leveraging of
systems change, and the imagining of post-neoliberal futures is the norm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过设计促进更温和和可持续的数字实践，基于可持续ICT和HCI文献。

Method: 分析了三个移动操作系统和九个代表性应用程序的环境设置，识别了六个普遍的反模式，并创建了一个设计手册。

Result: 发现环境设置普遍缺乏环保考虑，默认设置为最耗能选项，且设计鼓励高能耗使用。

Conclusion: 提出了改进环境设置的设计原则，并探讨了如何将个体行为与系统性因素联系起来。

Abstract: Designing for sufficiency is one of many approaches that could foster more
moderate and sustainable digital practices. Based on the Sustainable
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) literature, we identify five environmental settings categories. However,
our analysis of three mobile OS and nine representative applications shows an
overall lack of environmental concerns in settings design, leading us to
identify six pervasive anti-patterns. Environmental settings, where they exist,
are set on the most intensive option by default. They are not presented as
such, are not easily accessible, and offer little explanation of their impact.
Instead, they encourage more intensive use. Based on these findings, we create
a design workbook that explores design principles for environmental settings:
presenting the environmental potential of settings; shifting to environmentally
neutral states; previewing effects to encourage moderate use; rethinking
defaults; facilitating settings access and; exploring more frugal settings.
Building upon this workbook, we discuss how settings can tie individual
behaviors to systemic factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线游戏中的空间行为复杂且难以可视化，尤其是地图控制和前线的量化问题。

Method: 利用支持向量机从单位位置推导前线，并提供可视化展示。

Result: 展示了基于《坦克世界》的算法和可视化示例。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化地图控制和前线提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A central area of interest in many competitive online games is spatial
behavior which due to its complexity can be difficult to visualize. Such
behaviors of interest include not only overall movement patterns but also being
able to understand which player or team is exerting control over an area to
inform decision-making. Map control can, however, be challenging to quantify.
In this paper, we propose a method for calculating frontlines and first efforts
towards a visualization of them. The visualization can show map control and
frontlines at a specific time point or changes of these over time. For this
purpose, it utilizes support vector machines to derive frontlines from unit
positions. We illustrate our algorithm and visualization with examples based on
the team-based online game World of Tanks.

Conclusion: VR和XR为文化遗产研究提供了新视角，但需进一步优化合作与传播策略。

Abstract: Digital technologies and tools have transformed the way we can study cultural
heritage and the way we can recreate it digitally. Techniques such as laser
scanning, photogrammetry, and a variety of Mixed Reality solutions have enabled
researchers to examine cultural objects and artifacts more precisely and from
new perspectives. In this part of the panel, we explore how Virtual Reality
(VR) and eXtended Reality (XR) can serve as tools to recreate and visualize the
remains of historical cultural heritage and experience it in simulations of its
original complexity, which means immersive and interactive. Visualization of
material culture exemplified by archaeological sites and architecture can be
particularly useful when only ruins or archaeological remains survive. However,
these advancements also bring significant challenges, especially in the area of
transdisciplinary cooperation between specialists from many, often distant,
fields, and the dissemination of virtual immersive environments among both
professionals and the general public.

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) technologies such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR,
AR) are well established in medical practice, enhancing diagnostics, treatment,
and education. However, there are still some limitations and challenges that
may be overcome thanks to the latest generations of equipment, software, and
frameworks based on eXtended Reality (XR) by enabling immersive systems that
support safer, more controlled environments for training and patient care. Our
review highlights recent VR and AR applications in key areas of medicine. In
medical education, these technologies provide realistic clinical simulations,
improving skills and knowledge retention. In surgery, immersive tools enhance
procedural precision with detailed anatomical visualizations. VR-based
rehabilitation has shown effectiveness in restoring motor functions and
balance, particularly for neurological patients. In mental health, VR has been
successful in treating conditions like PTSD and phobias. Although VR and AR
solutions are well established, there are still some important limitations,
including high costs and limited tactile feedback, which may be overcome with
implementing new technologies that may improve the effectiveness of immersive
medical applications such as XR, psychophysiological feedback or integration of
artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time data analysis and personalized
healthcare and training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的分段引导框架，用于解决逆问题，平衡计算效率与引导精度，适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在逆问题中需要针对不同任务重新训练的问题，同时提高计算效率。

Method: 采用分段引导策略，根据扩散时间步长定义引导项，区分高噪声和低噪声阶段的不同近似方法。

Result: 在图像修复任务中，推理时间显著减少（25%至24%），PSNR和SSIM损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架具有问题无关性，能有效平衡效率与精度，适用于多种逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: DGAKT为知识追踪领域提供了高效且性能优越的新方法，填补了资源效率的空白。

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Conclusion: Innovator通过混合专家模型设计，成功实现科学知识与通用知识的解耦，显著提升科学任务性能且不影响通用能力。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

Result: 理论证明un-pruning误差有上界，实验验证其有效性，并发现MIA评估不可靠。

Conclusion: un-pruning方法适用于多种稀疏模型和剪枝方法，为稀疏模型遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示离线评估方法在衡量MAB算法探索行为时的不足，尤其是在上下文线性老虎机中。

Method: 通过广泛的离线实证比较，评估了多种线性MAB算法，并进行了超参数优化。

Result: 结果表明，纯利用策略在90%以上的数据集中表现最佳，超参数优化也倾向于最小化探索。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的评估方法的紧迫性，以更准确地反映探索行为的效果。

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

Motivation: 确保学习到的表示不受表面特征影响，提高预测的公平性和泛化性。

Result: CLEAR-VAE能交换样本内容与风格，并在新内容-风格组合下提升分类性能。

Conclusion: CLEAR有效分离任务相关与无关特征，增强模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了图神经网络（GNNs）在硬件故障（如位翻转错误）下的鲁棒性，并提出了一种轻量级解决方案Ralts，通过图相似性度量和保护性聚合函数提升GNN的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但现有研究主要关注软件层面的威胁，硬件故障的影响尚未充分研究。随着硬件系统向高性能和能效发展，瞬态故障（如位翻转）成为显著问题。

Method: 提出Ralts，利用图相似性度量过滤异常并恢复受损图拓扑，将保护技术直接集成到聚合函数中，适用于任何消息传递GNN。

Result: 在多种GNN模型、图数据集和错误模式下，Ralts显著提升鲁棒性。在BER为3×10⁻⁵时，预测准确率提升至少20%（权重或节点嵌入错误）和10%（邻接矩阵错误）。

Conclusion: Ralts是一种通用且高效的解决方案，显著增强了GNN对硬件故障的鲁棒性，同时保持了执行效率。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Squisher”的方法，通过复用训练过程中已计算的平方梯度累加器来近似Fisher对角矩阵，以减少计算成本。实验表明其性能接近Fisher对角矩阵，且优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisher对角矩阵常用于衡量参数敏感性，但其计算成本较高。自适应梯度方法（如Adam）在训练过程中已计算平方梯度的移动平均，因此探索是否可以利用这些已有数据近似Fisher对角矩阵。

Method: 提出“Squisher”方法，复用训练中已计算的平方梯度累加器作为Fisher对角矩阵的近似。通过五种应用场景的实验验证其有效性。

Result: Squisher在性能上与Fisher对角矩阵相近，且优于基线方法。论文还量化了Squisher与Fisher对角矩阵的具体差异及其影响。

Conclusion: Squisher提供了一种计算高效的Fisher对角矩阵近似方法，适用于多种应用场景，性能接近原始方法且优于基线。

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

Method: 提出了一种自监督数据选择标准，从离线数据集中选择与当前状态和评估目标相关的过渡数据，并通过少量梯度步微调策略。

Result: 实验表明，GC-TTT在高维运动导航和操作任务中显著优于标准离线预训练方法。

Conclusion: 结论是GC-TTT在计算成本相近的情况下，通过测试时训练实现了模型规模扩展无法达到的性能提升。

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高保真度的同时大幅降低了计算成本，为高能物理模拟提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在PDE求解中无法泛化到训练数据之外，例如固定雷诺数或预定义域。

Method: 利用PDE的尺度一致性特性设计数据增强方案和尺度感知神经算子，引入尺度一致性损失函数。

Result: 在多个PDE（如Burgers方程、Navier-Stokes方程等）上验证，模型在雷诺数250到10000范围内泛化能力显著提升，误差平均降低34%。

Conclusion: 尺度一致性损失和尺度感知神经算子有效提升了机器学习模型在PDE求解中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 高血压肾病ICU患者短期死亡率高，但缺乏定制化风险预测工具，需早期识别高风险个体以指导临床决策。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库的早期临床数据，筛选18个特征，训练并比较多种模型，CatBoost表现最优。

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在仅接收团队奖励时探索效率低，尤其是在稀疏奖励环境中。现有方法依赖手工设计的个体奖励，缺乏高阶智能。

Result: 实验表明LIGHT在性能和知识重用性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LIGHT有效提升了稀疏奖励任务中的探索效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）依赖分子拓扑结构，忽略了三维几何信息对通透性建模的重要性。

Method: GMC-MPNN通过引入原子级几何特征和长程相互作用，构建加权彩色子图以捕捉空间关系和化学背景。

Conclusion: GMC-MPNN通过整合空间几何信息，为药物发现提供了更准确和通用的工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯神经网络在甲状腺癌复发分类中表现出更高的准确性和不确定性量化能力，优于传统机器学习模型。

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

Motivation: 随着AI工作负载的增加，传统设计流程在探索设计空间方面的局限性促使开发自动化优化工具的需求。

Method: GENIAL采用两阶段训练的Transformer代理模型（自监督预训练和监督微调），并通过模型反演搜索最优操作数编码以最小化功耗。

Conclusion: GENIAL为数字系统的自动化组合电路生成迈出了重要一步，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

Method: 提出保守智能体，将随机延迟环境重新表述为恒定延迟等效环境，无需修改算法结构即可扩展应用。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，该方法在渐近性能和样本效率上显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 保守智能体方法为随机延迟环境提供了一种简单且有效的解决方案，扩展了现有技术的适用性。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Result: 在七个基准测试中，FADE在严重偏移下准确率提高19%，优于TENT和DIW，并适用于联邦学习。

Conclusion: FADE在理论和实证上均表现出鲁棒性，适用于多种模态和偏移强度。

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合GBM和异方差性，显著提升了金融时间序列生成的逼真度。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL在性能和可靠性上表现优异，已开源并在Ascend超级节点上验证。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Result: 在八个真实图数据集上验证，ProGMLP在保持高准确性的同时适应不同运行时场景。

Conclusion: ProGMLP适用于资源受限的多样化应用场景。

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

Conclusion: DyRC-VG框架通过动态信息优化储备网络结构，显著提升了预测性能，为复杂时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

Conclusion: CGIR通过子簇搜索与合并，统一了节点填补和嵌入优化框架，提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光伏板检测方法缺乏透明性、依赖大量高质量数据且难以泛化到新区域或不同环境，阻碍了大规模部署和电网优化。

Method: 提出PVAL框架，结合任务分解、输出标准化、少样本提示和精细调优，提升LLMs在光伏板检测中的性能。

Result: PVAL框架实现了透明、可扩展且适应性强的光伏板检测，减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: PVAL为大规模可再生能源集成和电网优化提供了自动化、可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

Motivation: 现有高压断路器状态监测方法依赖直接观测参数且需离线操作，无法满足在线监测需求。无监督方法可解决实际应用中缺乏故障标签的问题。

Method: 提出集成无监督故障检测与分割框架，仅需健康数据训练，结合可解释人工智能（XAI）进行故障诊断。

Result: 实验验证了框架在高压断路器健康与故障条件下的有效性，提升了系统可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高压断路器在线监测提供了无需标签的故障检测与诊断方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

Motivation: 早期检测NSCLC对改善患者预后至关重要，需要新方法辅助早期诊断。

Method: 收集227名受试者的咳嗽音频，使用SVM、XGBoost、CNN和VGG16等方法分析，并利用SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Result: CNN表现最佳（准确率0.83），SVM稍低但适合计算资源有限场景。公平性分析显示年龄差异（0.15）略高于性别差异（0.09）。

Conclusion: 研究结果可靠，但需更大、更多样化的数据集以验证，尤其是高风险人群和早期患者。

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟方法计算成本高且难以扩展，学习型方法未考虑输入层对预测精度的不同重要性。

Method: 提出Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA)机制，通过两阶段门控策略增强弱特征通道并抑制过强通道，结合ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net实现自适应特征表示。

Result: 在ICCAD-2023基准测试中，平均绝对误差降低61.1%，F1分数提升71.0%，优于竞赛冠军。

Conclusion: 通道异质性是VLSI物理布局分析的关键归纳偏差，WACA方法显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高能物理中实时粒子横向动量估计需要高效且准确的算法，现有静态机器学习模型在高堆积条件下性能下降，而通用图神经网络忽略了领域结构。

Method: 采用四种图构建策略（如站点为节点、特征为节点等）和新型消息传递层（带注意力机制和门控更新），结合领域特定损失函数。

Result: 在CMS触发数据集上验证，某配置实现了0.8525的MAE，参数比基线少55%以上；另一配置在保持效率的同时提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 物理引导的图神经网络在资源受限的触发系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在合成表格数据时难以保留特征间的功能依赖和逻辑依赖，影响了数据的结构保真度和下游应用效果。

Method: 提出HFGF框架，首先生成独立特征，再根据预定义的FD和LD规则重建依赖特征。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证，HFGF显著提升了六种生成模型（如CTGAN、TVAE等）对FDs和LDs的保留能力。

Conclusion: HFGF能显著提升合成表格数据的结构保真度和下游实用性。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

Motivation: 传统CFD模拟计算量大，难以集成到实时或设计迭代工作流中，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用三个神经网络：CAER提取和压缩流场特征，MLP映射入口速度到潜在表示，CNN作为聚合器结合单入口特征到双入口场景。

Result: CBML模型在训练和测试数据上均能快速准确地预测双入口场景的速度和温度场。

Conclusion: CBML方法为室内气流和温度分布的快速预测提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

Conclusion: NLL训练通过信息几何和谱对齐，隐式学习结构化表示空间，揭示了现代语言模型的有效性。

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

Conclusion: SPADA通过稀疏依赖建模，显著提升了表格数据增强的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: GENEO框架在数据有限的情况下表现出色，为无线通信网络中的信号重建提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,
and outlines promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: 模型多样性指存在多个机器学习模型对数据描述效果相同，但对个别样本预测不同。本文实证分析了医疗任务中模型多样性的影响，并提出小规模集成模型可减少多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中，模型多样性可能导致对同一患者的预测冲突，这一问题尚未被充分研究和解决。

Method: 通过分析不同医疗任务和模型架构，研究模型多样性的程度、驱动因素和影响，并测试小规模集成模型的效果。

Result: 标准验证指标无法识别唯一最优模型；小规模集成模型结合弃权策略可有效减少预测多样性；模型准确性提升也能减少多样性。

Conclusion: 临床应用中需考虑模型多样性，推荐使用集成模型提高诊断可靠性；若模型共识不足，建议交由专家评审。

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在解码时硬件效率低下，尤其是在长上下文推理任务中。Step-3旨在通过硬件优化的协同设计解决这一问题。

Method: Step-3采用多矩阵分解注意力（MFA）减少KV缓存和计算量，同时保持注意力表达能力；并通过注意力-FFN解耦（AFD）将注意力层和FFN层分离为专用子系统。

Result: Step-3显著降低了理论解码成本，在Hopper GPU上实现每秒4039个令牌的解码吞吐量，优于DeepSeek-V3。

Conclusion: Step-3通过硬件对齐的注意力算术强度、MoE稀疏性和AFD，实现了高效且成本效益的解码，为LLM解码设定了新的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

TL;DR: SILS框架通过动态、基于影响的方法识别高影响力流动性提供者（LPs），取代了传统的静态、基于规模的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖名义资本规模或表面活动，导致风险分析不准确，需要更精细的动态分析框架。

Method: 使用链上事件日志和智能合约执行痕迹计算指数时间加权流动性（ETWL）轮廓，并应用无监督异常检测，定义流动性稳定性影响分数（LSIS）。

Result: SILS能更准确地识别高影响力LPs，减少误报和漏报，提供透明度和风险管理机制。

Conclusion: SILS通过动态、影响导向的方法显著提升DeFi生态系统的风险管理和市场稳定性。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

Motivation: 研究如何捕捉潜在变化（上下文）以增强强化学习代理在训练范围之外的部署能力。

Method: 将上下文强化学习重新定义为双重推理-控制问题，提出观察充分性和控制充分性两个属性，并设计了基于信息瓶颈的BCPO算法。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，BCPO表现优于其他基线方法，样本效率更高且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了上下文强化学习的理论、诊断和实践，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释和可信决策的需求上升。随机森林因其集成特性难以解释。

Method: FGC 通过分组实例共享的决策路径，生成与模型内部逻辑一致的可解释聚类，并计算特征重要性得分。

Result: FGC 在基准数据集上准确恢复潜在子类结构，优于传统聚类和后解释方法；在AML转录组数据中揭示生物相关亚群。

Conclusion: FGC 填补了性能与可解释性之间的鸿沟，提供超越特征级别归因的结构感知洞察。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.
