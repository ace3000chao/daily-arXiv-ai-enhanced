Whether interactions\nbetween AI agents can replicate the synergy observed in human discussions\nremains an open question. To investigate this, we systematically compared four\nconversational configurations: pairs of large language models (LLM-LLM), trios\nof LLMs, trios of humans, and mixed human-LLM pairs. After agents answered\nquestions individually, they engaged in open-ended discussions and then\nreconsidered their initial answers. Interactions involving humans consistently\nled to accuracy improvements after the conversations, benefiting both stronger\nand weaker participants. By contrast, purely LLM-based pairs and trios\nexhibited declines in accuracy, demonstrating limited conversational synergy.\nAnalysis of participants' confidence and answer-switching behavior revealed\nthat knowledge diversity is a critical factor enabling collaborative\nimprovement. Crucially, the lack of gains in LLM-LLM interactions did not stem\nfrom a fundamental limitation of the models' ability to collaborate, but from\nhighly similar knowledge states that left little room for productive exchange.\nOur findings argue for a paradigm shift in AI development: rather than\noptimizing individual models solely for standalone performance, explicitly\ncultivating diversity across agents, even at the cost of slightly lower\nindividual accuracy, may yield AI collaborators that are more effective in\ngroup settings with humans or other AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u4ee3\u7406\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7eafLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5219\u56e0\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e00\u6837\u4ea7\u751f\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u914d\u7f6e\uff1aLLM-LLM\u5bf9\u3001LLM\u4e09\u4eba\u7ec4\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e09\u4eba\u7ec4\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b-LLM\u6df7\u5408\u5bf9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u8bdd\u524d\u540e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7eafLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56e0\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u534f\u4f5c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5f00\u53d1\u5e94\u6ce8\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative\nautoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by\nautoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a\nconvenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future\nscan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's\nprevious scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block\nvia cross-attention.

These channels enable the anonymous trade of\nillicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and\ncategorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the\nevolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online\nsources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based\ncomputation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations\non K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and\nfull-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier\ndetection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and\nsmallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.\n  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,\n7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the\nA100 GPU and Atom, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "KLLM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cf\u5316\uff08WAQ\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6WAQ\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ceOrizuru\u3002", "result": "KLLM\u5728A100 GPU\u548cAtom\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e869.67x\u548c7.03x\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347229.50x\u548c150.21x\u3002", "conclusion": "KLLM\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653e\u4e86K-Means\u91cf\u5316\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite its\ngrowing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that\nsystematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This\nwork fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of\ndiscrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative\nVQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their\nalgorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM\npipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research\nin terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality\nsystems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization\nstrategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In\naddition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable\ngradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints.

In this\nstudy, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function\nautonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We\nretrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic\nand board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth\nencounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan\nconsistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based\nadjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic\nand clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%\nof cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not\nsupported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI\nperformance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;\nthe diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this\nfirst large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong\ndiagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI\nperformance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.\nThese findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical\ndecision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare\nworkforce shortages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edfDoctronic\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7d27\u6025\u62a4\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u9762\u4e34\u533b\u7597\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u88ab\u884c\u653f\u8d1f\u62c5\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cAI\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Doctronic\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728500\u6b21\u7d27\u6025\u62a4\u7406\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f2\u5ba1\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "Doctronic\u4e0e\u533b\u751f\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u4e3a81%\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u4e3a99.2%\uff0c\u65e0\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u536036.1%\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53609.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0a\u53ef\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u4eba\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across\nthe diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world\napplications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are\ntrained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.\nMeanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are\nfragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance\ncomputing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,\nwe present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a\ntransformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of\nmaterials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and\ntungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured\nand unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of\ntextual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and\nsolver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation\nacross simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture.

We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall\nperformance and generalization across different types of landmarks.

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios.

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has\nemerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of\nindividual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,\nthis approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the\nnecessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training\nsamples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and\nscenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the\ndifficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that\nmemorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link\nbetween memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This\nconnection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of\nincremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in\nunlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on\nmore efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned\ncognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence\nApproximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from\nthe incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nIAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,\nand comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods\nacross diverse datasets and model architectures.

In this work, we investigate the function\nof process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We\npropose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism\noperating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based\ntraining.

Results: We empirically demonstrate that the\nNLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by\n40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have\nprevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision\nin derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could\nfacilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key\nstudy parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of\nfind-ings derived from database studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6ce2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NLP\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6ce2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u524d\u7ec8\u6b62\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "NLP\u8f85\u52a9\u5ba1\u6838\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8640%\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u591a\u6ce2\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e8677%\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u5ba1\u6838\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research\nfocused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in\ncomprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true\ncompared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from\nextensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex\nthan text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one\nchallenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as\nphonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.\nAdditionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn\ninteraction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics.

Our findings reveal\nconsistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for\nsmaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified\npromising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain\nmore stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse\nrelationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend\nto perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient\n\\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings\nhighlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the\nneed for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to\nmultilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for\nunderrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language\ntechnologies worldwide.

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning.

However, existing methods often only consider single-relational\ngraphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability\nto fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition\nsentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nMRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on\nmulti-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization.

However, prior\nwork has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply\nreject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user\nrequests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm\nwhere models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to\nresolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC\nand GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical\nreasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math\nproblems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify\nand request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty\nby introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.\nExperiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models\nexcel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and\ninference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,\nespecially smaller ones.

Experiments on TCGA\nmicrobiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),\ncosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer\ntypes, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome\nimputation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DepMicroDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5Transformer\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "DepMicroDiff\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5Transformer\uff0c\u5229\u7528VAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cLLM\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728TCGA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDepMicroDiff\u5728Pearson\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DepMicroDiff\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Additionally, current methods rely\nheavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize\nexisting problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization\nability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some\nstudies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general\ndomains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not\nadequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented\n**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning.

This question of model selection is traditionally\nanswered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and\ntime-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using\npredictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data\npoints that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,\nperforms consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships\nbetween classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic\nframework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in\nthe candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian\ninference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is\ncollected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark\ntasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing\nmethods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation\neffort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the\nprevious state-of-the-art.

Identifying logical rules not only improves the\ncompleteness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential\nerrors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for\nreasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined\nwith the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for\nhumans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language\nmodels to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.\nSpecifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery\nalgorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,\nFB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including\nzero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and\nchain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the\ngenerated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and\nalso assess the use of large language models as automatic judges.
