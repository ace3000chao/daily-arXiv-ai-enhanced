The Cases of Caste and Religion", "comment": "Accepted to AIES 2025", "summary": "Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been\nmeasured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global\nNorth-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's\nsystematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to\naddress, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI\noversight.", "AI": {"tldr": "MI9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "MI9\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u516d\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6570\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u9065\u6d4b\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u6388\u6743\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7ea7\u904f\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "MI9\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "MI9\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset\nof texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the\nLLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including\nperforming post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and\ntrustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,\nstate-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation\ncost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a\nsingle response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context\ntraceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a\nprompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical\ninsights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for\nAttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and\nefficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy.

Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose\ntime constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was\nsystematically manipulated. During the operation, eye movements were recorded\nwhile participants fixated on a visual target. After each condition,\nparticipants provided subjective ratings of maneuverability and cognitive load.\nAs the platform's time constant increased, the perceived maneuverability scores\ndecreased while the cognitive loads increased.

Existing methods typically leverage either global\nlow-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers\nfrom notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and\nmay disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often\nrequire extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)\nmodel that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker\ndecomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a\nself-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker\ncore, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based\nregularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting\nnonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with\nprovable convergence guarantees.

To address this issue, we introduce A11yShape, a\nnovel system designed to help BLV users who possess basic programming skills\nunderstand, modify, and iterate on 3-D models. A11yShape leverages LLMs and\nintegrates with OpenSCAD, a popular open-source editor that generates 3-D\nmodels from code. Key functionalities of A11yShape include accessible\ndescriptions of 3-D models, version control to track changes in models and\ncode, and a hierarchical representation of model components.

However, social interactions have two key\ncharacteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,\nwhere utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit\nassignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as\nrapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal\nachievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL\nwith single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable.

This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our\nevaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of\nthe U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7f51\u7edc\uff08U-PINet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "U-PINet\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd1\u573a\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "U-PINet\u5728\u8868\u9762\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "U-PINet\u4e3a\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing\nmore detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users\nare on the move and cannot visually track progress. Longer-form communication,\nsuch as composing structured emails or thoughtful responses, requires\npersistent context tracking, structured guidance, and adaptability to evolving\nuser intentions--capabilities that conventional dictation tools and voice\nassistants do not support. We introduce StepWrite, a large language\nmodel-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability\nby enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form\ntexts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into\nmanageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware\nnon-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the\ncontext-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline\nmethods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and\nconversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite\ndynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent,\nand provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical\nevaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied\nactivities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load,\nimproves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods.\nTechnical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic\ncontextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact\nchecking.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons.

HarmonyGuard\nfeatures a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental\ncapabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent\nwithin HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured\nsecurity policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously\nupdating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective\nOptimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility\nAgent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning\nto evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their\noptimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that\nHarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up\nto 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance\nacross all tasks.

However, existing\nmethods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when\nnew behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language\nmodels (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,\nsuffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose\nZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly\nfrom raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise\nfeature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every\nactivity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,\nand a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select\nfeatures, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and\nnatural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR\nwithout any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.", "AI": {"tldr": "ZARA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6d3b\u52a8\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "ZARA\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3001\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2aHAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cZARA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad82.53\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "ZARA\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAIRS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u68c0\u7d22\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u6863\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PAIRS\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePAIRS\u51cf\u5c1125%\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad81.1% EM\u548c1.0% F1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAIRS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,\nOmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create\nscenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine\ncross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal\nmodels reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on\nhigh-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges\nrequiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this\nfragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic\nperformance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive\n\"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically\nimprove performance.

However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even\ncover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT\npost-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of\nrule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient\nalternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for\nGUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a\nreinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical\nstudy and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of\nRFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we\ndecompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of\neach.

Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off\nin performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good\njob of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points\ntowards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when\nthese less useful points are eventually added.

The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities.

In these domains,\nfairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a\ncommon challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade\nAUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional\nOptimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework\nthat strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups\nusing optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable\nproportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged\ngroup. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between\nreducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,\nwe extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions\nto concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,\npublic, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms\nexisting post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,\noften achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive\ngains in utility.

Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research\ntask remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive\nproblems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal\ncharacterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to\nevaluate the performance of DR systems.

To enable objective evaluation, we\ndefine DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims\nuncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level\nreport generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging\nbenchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,\ndatasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events\n(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1\nscore ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model\nperforms the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55.

This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously\ncollect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user\nbehaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor\ndata, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large\nquantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user\nagency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,\nfew-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method\nintroduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization\nstrategy.

Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139\nminutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs\nexcelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred\nhigh computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while\nfine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.\nFurther analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can\nrival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting\nopportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between\naccuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models\nbalancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data.

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

The results\ndemonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded\nprompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and\nfactual validity.

Existing Private Inference (PI)\nmethods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:\ncryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational\noverhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose\nintermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm\nfor private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with\ndistributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client\ninto multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,\nnon-communicating servers for independent partial inference.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic\nframework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency\ndemands of a large-scale industrial system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTURA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u7968\u52a1\u5e93\u5b58\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u9759\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "TURA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u3001DAG\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "result": "TURA\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "TURA\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001RAG\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u641c\u7d22\u4ea7\u54c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they\noften degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a\nsuperior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks\nhardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision\narithmetic units that limit acceleration.\n  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization\nframework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.\nFlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with\nadaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise\nsensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized\nhigh-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8\nrepresentations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing\nthe lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ\nmaintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.\nThe proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on\nLLaMA-2-70B linear layers.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter.

Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings.

The main conceptual novelty of our\napproach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the\nboundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector\nfield to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem\nstructure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5355\u8c03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u77e9\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u8c03Lipschitz\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u6307\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}
