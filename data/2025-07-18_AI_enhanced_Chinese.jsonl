What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784(MSA)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u8c03\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u60f3\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784(MSA)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\"\u6a21\u578b\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\"\u4f53\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "MSA\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u8fd8\u662f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u751f\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MSA\u80fd\u591f\u955c\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6309\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5373\u5224\u65ad\u53e5\u5b50\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u624d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u4ece\u95ee\u7b54\u5230\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff08\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5411\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u62e5\u6709\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u4ee5\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, critical\noverdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays\nand information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of\nDisease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may\nautomate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been\nlimited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in\n2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was\nconducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.\nMultiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug\ninvolvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included\ntraditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned\nencoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large\nlanguage models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed\nusing macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to\nquantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect\nperformance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set.

This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model\n(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified\nevaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore\nAudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including\npronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and\nsystem-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We\ninvestigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio\nconcatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves\nperformance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference\nsimulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to\nenable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes\nspeech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,\nand paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with\nhuman preferences on our system ranking benchmark.

This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,\nwhich typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often\nleads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of\nout-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we\ndevelop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.\nOur models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the\ninput byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing\ntokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss\nthat enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing\na new kind of rigidity.

One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing\ntime of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly\nremove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing\nconcerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the\nproposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven\nstate-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and\npresented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.\nAdditionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time\nwith a negligible loss in accuracy.

To this end, we\nconducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day\npublic event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside\nsemi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we\nanalyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including\na subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and\nshared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The\nsurvey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and\nat work. However, concerns were raised regarding task execution reliability. In\ncontrast, cost and human-like interaction were not dominant concerns.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics\nthrough a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific\ndistillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion\nregression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and\nmultimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset.

While Transformer-based\narchitectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence\nlength hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements\nin State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for\nlong-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and\ntransient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise\nissues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier\nand Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.\nFLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to\neffectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within\ntime series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise\nissue.

NTKs typically actively change during\ntraining and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5NAMMD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3MMD\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86NAMMD-DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMMD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u4e00\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3002MMD\u867d\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAMMD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RKHS\u8303\u6570\u5bf9MMD\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eNAMMD\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1NAMMD-DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eNAMMD-DCT\u6bd4MMD-DCT\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u9a8c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7c7b\u578bI\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NAMMD-DCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eMMD-DCT\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,\ntraining generative models typically requires large datasets and significant\ncomputational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.\nAcquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many\nunderutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying\ncapabilities remain idle.

However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying\nlayer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence\nof graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This\nwork revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir\nGraph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a\nvariant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of\nsurface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification.

Recognizing the\nimportance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the\nWaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor\nutilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting\nvibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early\nnetwork layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network\neffectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement\nspeeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal\ndependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors\nfor health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a\nsequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,\ncapturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.\nThis architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of\ninfrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track\nstiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the\nmodel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway\nballast and railpad stiffness parameters.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations.

That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT\nin low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space.

This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates\ndiverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial\ninformation, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as\ndeveloping countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large\nlanguage model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM\nfunctioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable\neffective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations.

To combat these\nproblems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from\nLipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point\nwhere researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with\na Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we\nbegin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for\nmaintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able\nto train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.\nWe find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves\nstandard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models\nto reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's\nupdate having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method\nthat improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter\ntransformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches\nvalidation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz\ntransformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the\nNanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound\nincreases to 10^264.
