### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见主要源于预训练阶段，而非微调或随机训练噪声。通过多轮微调和交叉调优实验，揭示了预训练对偏见模式的决定性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中认知偏见的来源，区分预训练、微调和训练随机性的影响，以指导未来偏见评估和缓解策略的开发。

Method: 采用两步因果实验方法：1）多次微调模型以研究训练随机性对30多种认知偏见的影响；2）引入交叉调优（交换指令数据集）以隔离偏见来源。

Result: 训练随机性带来一定变异性，但偏见模式主要由预训练决定：共享预训练主干的模型比仅共享微调数据的模型表现出更相似的偏见模式。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏见需考虑其预训练起源，这一视角可为未来评估和缓解LLMs偏见的策略提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在规范性调查中的响应鲁棒性，发现所有测试模型均表现出不同程度的“近因偏差”，且对语义变化敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为人类受试者代理在社会科学调查中的可靠性和易受已知响应偏差影响的程度。

Method: 测试9种不同LLMs，应用11种扰动（问题表述和答案选项结构），生成超过167,000次模拟访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出近因偏差，较大模型更鲁棒，但对语义变化和组合扰动仍敏感。

Conclusion: 提示设计和鲁棒性测试对使用LLMs生成合成调查数据至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于全面评估合成文本的工具包，支持多维度评估，包括实用性、公平性、隐私风险等，旨在提升合成文本的可行性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成文本在AI开发中具有潜力，但需要系统评估以确保其在不同领域的适用性和隐私安全性。

Method: 提供多维度评估工具，支持用户上传或生成合成文本，并在医疗和法律等高风险领域验证其功能。

Result: 工具包能够标准化评估指标，提升合成文本的可行性和隐私保护效果。

Conclusion: SynthTextEval为合成文本的评估和隐私保护提供了标准化解决方案，促进了AI开发的可持续发展。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对医疗领域大语言模型（LLMs）的安全性评估协议，填补了现有文献的空白，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是对患者和临床医生的潜在影响。现有评估多关注通用领域，缺乏针对医疗场景的专门研究。

Method: 设计了医疗领域专用的安全性评估协议，包括患者和临床医生视角，并构建了包含466个样本的PatientSafetyBench数据集。以MediPhi模型为案例进行了红队测试。

Result: 首次从患者、临床医生和普通用户三个视角定义了医疗LLMs的安全性评估标准，为医疗领域的安全部署奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗LLMs的安全性评估提供了新方法，强调了多视角评估的重要性，有助于推动医疗领域的安全应用。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习中的打断行为对小组互动和知识构建有重要影响，但现有研究多集中于单对话环境，难以应对多组对话中的重叠语音问题。

Method: 分析了单对话和多组对话环境中的打断检测，提出了一种对重叠语音鲁棒的打断识别方法。

Result: 开发了一种适用于课堂环境的状态识别方法，并揭示了打断行为的语言和韵律特征。

Conclusion: 为未来研究在多组对话中跟踪打断行为提供了基础，并强调了重叠语音的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多代理检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康错误信息的反驳言论，通过结合静态和动态证据优化生成结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在生成反驳言论时依赖有限证据且对输出控制不足，需改进。

Method: 采用多代理检索增强框架，结合多个LLM优化知识检索、证据增强和响应精炼。

Result: 方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线，并通过消融研究和人工评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量反驳言论，且精炼步骤显著提升质量并获人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，用于高效处理长文本，避免了传统Transformer的二次计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长文本时因二次计算复杂度导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，利用实时端到端图生成机制处理字符级输入，无需填充或截断，并整合LLM信息。

Result: 模型在多文本分类任务中表现高效且竞争力强，生成的图具有语义组织特征。

Conclusion: 新模型在保持高效的同时，性能与现有最优模型相当。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl是一个可控制可读性的指令调优框架，显著降低了AI生成医疗内容的可读性错误，优于GPT-4，并在临床任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域中AI生成内容在个性化与可读性之间的平衡问题，以提升患者教育和医疗公平性。

Method: 提出MedReadCtrl框架，通过指令调优调整输出复杂度，同时保持医学意图。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中表现优于GPT-4，专家更偏好其输出，尤其在低识字水平群体中效果显著。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl为医疗AI提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够生成易读且准确的医疗内容。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

### [9] [SynthEHR-Eviction: Enhancing Eviction SDoH Detection with LLM-Augmented Synthetic EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07421)
*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction是一个结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化的管道，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公开驱逐相关SDoH数据集，性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的重要社会决定因素，但研究不足，且电子健康记录中缺乏结构化数据，限制了应用。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）构建管道，提取临床记录中的驱逐状态。

Result: 创建了包含14个细粒度类别的最大公开驱逐相关SDoH数据集，微调LLMs性能优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。

Conclusion: 该管道显著减少标注工作量，加速数据集创建，并可推广到其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

*Matthieu Boileau,Philippe Helluy,Jeremy Pawlus,Svitlana Vyetrenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小型指令调优语言模型中，以构建可解释的时间序列基础模型。

Method: 利用合成数据集生成自然语言注释，监督微调小型Qwen模型。

Result: 微调后的模型具备有意义的解释能力，适合隐私敏感或设备端部署。

Conclusion: 证明了将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [11] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SAND框架，通过自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作评估，帮助LLM代理在行动前进行候选动作的显式思考，从而提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法可能导致LLM代理过度依赖看似合理但次优的动作，缺乏对候选动作的充分探索和比较。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自我一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作评估，生成逐步动作思考，并利用这些轨迹微调LLM代理。

Result: 在两个代表性交互任务中，SAND比初始监督微调平均提升20%，并优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: SAND通过显式动作思考提升了LLM代理的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLEP是一种两阶段强化学习框架，通过重放已验证的高质量轨迹来提升训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在大语言模型中的训练不稳定和策略漂移问题。

Method: RLEP分两阶段：收集已验证轨迹，并在训练中重放这些轨迹以优化策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能，如AIME-2024准确率从38.2%提升至39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量轨迹，实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出“机器废话”作为大语言模型（LLM）中真实性缺失的框架，并引入“废话指数”和分类法，通过实验验证RLHF和CoT提示对废话的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM中真实性缺失的广泛现象，揭示其机制，为更真实的LLM行为提供新见解。

Method: 提出废话指数和四种废话分类法，在多个数据集（包括新设计的BullshitEval）上进行实证评估。

Result: RLHF显著加剧废话，CoT提示放大特定废话形式，政治语境中废话普遍，以模棱两可为主。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING框架通过从大模型中提取任务分解知识并微调小模型，显著提升了小模型在复杂推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用任务分解（规划轨迹）提升小模型的复杂推理能力，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 从大模型中蒸馏合成任务分解（规划轨迹），并通过监督和强化学习目标微调小模型。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准上平均提升7%，在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024上分别提升10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是提升小模型任务特定性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TeaR方法，通过数据筛选和强化学习提升LLM的推理能力，实验显示在多任务基准上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，但现有方法因依赖复杂代码结构导致过拟合，需改进。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，指导模型发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在17个基准测试中，TeaR显著提升性能，如Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升LLM推理能力，尤其在代码相关任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Motivation: ORR催化剂对提升燃料电池效率至关重要，但从复杂多样的文献中提取结构化信息具有挑战性。

Method: 使用DyGIE++结合MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT等预训练BERT变体，进行数据标注、模型微调，评估不同BERT模型在NER和RE任务中的表现。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1-score达82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中F1-score为66.10%，领域特定模型优于通用模型。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在AI中的广泛应用，人们对其能力边界（如幻觉问题）和代理用途的兴趣日益增长，因此需要明确LLMs能完成和不能完成的任务类型。

Method: 从LLM推理的计算复杂性角度出发，分析其任务执行和验证能力的上限。

Result: 研究表明LLMs无法执行或验证超出特定复杂度的计算和代理任务，并提供了相关示例。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了LLMs在复杂任务中的局限性，对实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语语言中心理支持数据集稀缺的问题，提供高质量的心理咨询对话资源。

Method: 通过对话生成器和修改器构建CPsDD数据集，并设计CADSS系统，包含分析用户特征的Profiler、总结对话历史的Summarizer、选择策略的Planner和生成共情回应的Supporter。

Result: 构建了包含68K对话的CPsDD数据集，CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架和系统为心理支持领域提供了有效的数据和工具，填补了非英语语言资源的空白。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Result: 基于三人对话训练的VAP模型表现优于基线，但对话类型影响准确性。

Conclusion: VAP可用于三人对话轮流发言预测，未来将整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在少样本提示下对多语言主观性检测的有效性，尤其是在标注数据稀缺或不一致时的表现。

Method: 使用精心设计的少样本提示，结合LLMs，并尝试高级提示工程技术（如辩论式提示和示例选择策略）。

Result: 在CheckThat! 2025任务中表现突出，阿拉伯语和波兰语排名第一，其他语言和多语言赛道均进入前四。

Conclusion: LLMs的少样本学习在多语言情感任务中高效且适应性强，为传统微调提供了有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注生成部分，且依赖开放领域数据（如维基百科），忽略了检索中的语言不平衡等问题。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究特定领域中的跨语言RAG。

Method: 使用来自真实企业数据集的阿拉伯语-英语基准测试，涵盖查询和支持文档的所有语言组合，并随机抽取数据。提出了一种强制均衡检索的策略。

Conclusion: 跨语言检索在特定领域应用中仍有改进空间，提出的策略为实际RAG应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL在VLM中的联合效果，以提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 通过多种训练策略（如两阶段、交错或渐进训练）和数据混合、模型合并，研究SFT和RL的相互作用。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题表现但引入冗余，RL促进泛化和简洁性；两者结合未能实现叠加优势。

Conclusion: 需要更无缝和自适应的方法来充分发挥联合后训练技术的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Result: 显著提升翻译质量，尤其在跨域泛化和复杂文档图像场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: M4Doc框架高效且有效，适用于文档图像机器翻译任务。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Method: 通过蒙特卡罗边际化对K个独立噪声样本进行平均，以收敛到后验分布，并引入推理时集成方法。

Result: 在WikiText-2上，该方法实现了测试困惑度8.8（K=8），优于GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需额外训练成本的后验感知概率和不确定性估计，显著提升了语言模型的性能。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在NLP任务中表现优异，但其高计算需求限制了在资源受限环境中的部署，因此研究压缩模型的可行性。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏（KD）从Pythia和Qwen2.5家族中提取学生模型，并在SQuAD和MLQA基准测试中评估零样本和单样本提示条件下的性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可以在模型效率和性能之间取得平衡，适用于资源受限的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注RAG的准确性和召回率，而忽略了检索效率的重要性。本文旨在证明无需大规模微调即可提升RAG性能，并减少检索搜索次数。

Method: 采用标准ReAct流程并优化提示，结合少量监督和基于强化学习的微调，以减少检索搜索次数。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中，优化后的方法优于现有技术，且检索搜索次数减少近一半。

Conclusion: 优化提示和少量训练数据可显著提升RAG效率，无需大规模微调。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Method: 研究将PCR分为四类表面形式，构建了包含500个自然发生的语音伪装攻击帖子的数据集，并评估了现有大语言模型的性能。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差。通过错误分析，重新评估了拼音提示策略，发现其能显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个中文PCR分类、真实基准数据集及轻量级改进方法，推动了毒性检测的鲁棒性研究。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，结合摘要长度压缩，量化语义保留与压缩的权衡。

Result: 实验表明NOIR能有效捕捉语义保留与压缩的权衡，并与人类对摘要质量的感知相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为摘要任务提供自动化评估工具，适用于改进摘要算法、提示和合成摘要。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Motivation: 研究发现多头注意力（MHA）性能随注意力头数增加而提升，但需保持每个头的隐藏维度足够大。因此，如何在最小参数开销下增加头数和隐藏维度成为关键。

Method: 提出SAS方法，通过低维投影模拟更多头和隐藏维度，并扩展至键和查询嵌入的特征维度。同时引入参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）控制参数量。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务上的实验表明，SAS方法显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法通过模拟更大模型的行为，实现了性能提升且保持模型紧凑性，为注意力机制优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性上均优于传统RAG实现，为知识扩展提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架，验证其原始结果，并通过参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重构实验和嵌入量化防御研究扩展实验。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效重构文本，甚至密码类序列，但对输入长度敏感；高斯噪声和量化技术可降低隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用文本嵌入，并进一步研究NLP系统的鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种选择性对齐策略，通过优先处理偏好对中高影响力标记，减少计算开销并提高对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的后训练对齐是一个关键挑战，因为并非所有标记对模型性能的贡献均等。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异，选择高影响力标记进行对齐。

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，选择性DPO方法优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对提升LLM偏好对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律领域的应用，提出了一种创新的双重分类法，整合法律推理框架和专业本体，系统化历史研究与当代突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补法律领域LLMs应用的综述空白，为研究者和从业者提供技术路线图和概念框架。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的LLMs，结合稀疏注意力机制和专家混合架构，动态捕捉法律语义并统一证据推理。

Result: 在任务泛化、推理形式化、工作流整合等方面取得显著进展，但也面临幻觉、可解释性不足等挑战。

Conclusion: 提出新的分类法，系统化法律推理、检索、预测和争议解决，为下一代法律人工智能奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the
relevant papers: https://github.com/Kilimajaro/LLMs_Meet_Law.

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式语音翻译方法依赖句子级分段，限制了上下文信息，且策略学习复杂。StreamUni旨在解决这些问题。

Method: StreamUni利用语音CoT引导LSLM生成多阶段输出，实现分段、策略决策和翻译生成。提出流式CoT训练方法提升低延迟策略能力。

Result: 实验表明，StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型和多阶段输出，高效完成流式语音翻译，无需额外策略训练。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以实现从连续表示到具体逻辑公式的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号知识整合到数据驱动学习中需要语义一致的逻辑公式嵌入，并且这些嵌入需要可逆以实现从优化后的连续表示到具体需求的转换。

Method: 通过训练一个仅解码器的Transformer模型，反转STL公式的语义嵌入，并使用小词汇表生成有效公式。

Result: 模型在1个周期后即可生成有效公式，约10个周期后能泛化到逻辑语义，并能生成更简单但语义接近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在需求挖掘任务中表现有效，可直接在语义空间中进行优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Result: 重复神经元的影响因层深不同而异，提出了减少重复输出同时保持ICL性能的策略。

Conclusion: 从技能神经元角度分析为优化LLMs的重复模式识别和ICL性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT)的新方法，通过调整指令调优中提示和响应令牌的损失权重，优化了传统指令调优的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优中，损失函数仅计算响应令牌而忽略提示令牌，这可能不是最优选择。研究旨在探索不同权重分配对模型性能的影响。

Method: 提出了WIT方法，系统地研究了提示和响应令牌在损失函数中的权重分配，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，传统指令调优损失函数性能次优，而WIT方法（适度加权提示令牌和高加权响应令牌）显著提升了模型性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了重新考虑指令调优损失函数的必要性，并提供了开发更鲁棒、通用模型的实用建议。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Method: 在固定源分词器的基础上，学习目标分词器，最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中未见改进，但在语言建模任务中困惑度有所降低。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次方复杂度可能限制了数据效率，未来需探索其他参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG框架在NLP中表现优异，但共指复杂性会降低其效果，需系统性研究其影响。

Method: 通过比较不同检索池化策略和QA任务，分析共指消解对检索和生成的影响。

Result: 共指消解提升检索效果，小模型在QA任务中受益更显著；均值池化在共指消解后表现最佳。

Conclusion: 共指复杂性是RAG的挑战，共指消解可优化检索和生成，为知识密集型AI应用提供指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Result: 证明了Game Theorem，展示了语义均衡的存在性和唯一性。

Conclusion: 框架结合了范畴论和信息论，具有实际应用价值，超越了纯数学抽象。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式健康代理（CHAs）缺乏自适应多轮推理和透明决策能力，限制了其在临床诊断中的实用性。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分解为三个阶段（症状收集、病史获取、因果图构建），并利用可解释的置信度分数指导自适应提问和推理优化。

Result: 在两个中文咨询数据集上，DocCHA诊断准确率提升5.18%，症状召回率提升30%，对话轮次仅小幅增加。

Conclusion: DocCHA通过结构化、透明的诊断对话，为多语言和资源受限环境中的可信LLM临床助手奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Result: 显著减少准备时间，降低人工错误，支持并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中LLM的广泛应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant

topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）提升工业异常检测和推理能力，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，缺乏可解释性和泛化能力，SAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAGE结合SFE和E-DPO方法，利用AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。

Result: SAGE在零样本和少样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了更精确、结构化和上下文感知的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

Motivation: 现有AI记忆系统功能有限，无法实现个性化、抽象化和可靠回忆，MIRIX旨在解决这一核心挑战。

Method: MIRIX采用六种结构化记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库）和多智能体框架，支持动态更新和检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA和LOCOMO任务中，MIRIX分别比基线方法提升了35%的准确率和99.9%的存储效率，并达到85.4%的最先进性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型语言模型设定了新的性能标准，并通过实际应用展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，隐式奖励模型（IM-RMs）在泛化能力上不如显式奖励模型（EX-RMs），主要原因是IM-RMs更依赖表面标记级线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨隐式和显式奖励模型在泛化能力上的差异，揭示其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RMs和EX-RMs的泛化行为，验证其依赖的线索类型。

Result: IM-RMs因依赖标记级线索而泛化能力较差，尤其是在标记级分布变化时。

Conclusion: 设计选择对奖励模型的泛化行为有显著影响，IM-RMs的局限性需引起重视。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 探索如何在资源有限的医疗环境中利用语言模型支持临床决策，同时降低能耗和成本。

Method: 使用小型语言模型（SLMs）结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，与大型语言模型（LLMs）进行比较。

Result: SLMs+RAG在诊断和治疗性能上优于LLMs，且能耗更低，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: SLMs+RAG在风湿病学中具有潜力，但专家监督仍是必要的，因模型未达到专家级准确度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: 现有评估方法在医学推理能力评估上存在不足，缺乏严谨、可扩展的基准测试。

Method: 提出MedThink-Bench基准测试和LLM-w-Ref评估框架，利用专家标注的逐步推理和LLM-as-a-Judge机制。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关，小模型（如MedGemma-27B）表现优于大模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为医学推理评估提供了基础工具，推动LLM在临床实践中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法受限于预定义工作流和静态工具集，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 开发PyVision框架，支持多轮交互，动态生成和执行Python工具。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，GPT-4.1和Claude-4.0-Sonnet性能分别提升7.8%和31.1%。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型不仅能使用工具，还能发明工具，推动更自主的视觉推理。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

Motivation: 探究前沿LLMs在简单推理任务上的表现，揭示其失败原因，并验证任务简化是否提升模型性能。

Method: 生成包含计数、一阶逻辑等简单任务的套件，并引入“unpuzzles”数据集，测试模型在简化任务上的表现。

Result: 模型在简单任务上表现不佳，失败模式与统计捷径、中间步骤错误和长上下文处理相关。简化任务未提升性能。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在简单推理任务上的泛化能力仍有问题，任务简化不保证性能提升。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型扩展方法资源密集且缺乏灵活性，本文探索了一种基于固定嵌入的替代方案，以实现高效、灵活的模型扩展。

Method: 使用非训练性、确定性输入嵌入作为通用接口，支持模块化组合（如专家模型合并）和逐层增长的训练方法。

Result: 模块化组合后的模型在MMLU等基准上表现优于单个专家模型；逐层增长方法能稳定收敛并提升复杂推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种更生物化或构造性的AI开发范式，支持资源高效扩展和模块自由组合，为AI系统开发开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: 现有CIR方法在时尚领域表现不佳，因缺乏大规模标注数据和细粒度理解能力。

Method: 构建自动标注的FACap数据集，并提出FashionBLIP-2模型，结合轻量适配器和多头部查询-候选匹配。

Result: FashionBLIP-2在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ基准测试中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型有效解决了时尚领域CIR的挑战，适用于电商等高需求场景。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘（MU）是一种低成本的方法，用于从扩散模型中清除不需要的信息，但难以验证信息是否完全移除且可能损害模型性能。

Method: 提出autoeval-dmun工具，利用（视觉）语言模型评估遗忘效果，提取相关知识并识别可能受损的邻近概念。

Result: 语言模型能有效排序邻近概念（与遗忘损害相关）并通过对抗提示绕过遗忘。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为评估扩散模型遗忘效果提供了自动化解决方案，并验证了语言模型的实用性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP是一种结合GNN节点编码和最短路径序列建模的新框架，用于提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链接特定的结构模式，且现有方法计算成本高或依赖简单启发式方法。

Method: SP4LP先通过GNN计算节点表示，再提取节点对的最短路径并用序列模型处理。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最优性能，且理论证明其表达能力更强。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一种高效且通用的链接预测方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

Result: DeCoLe在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，优于其他标签错误检测方法。

Conclusion: DeCoLe为解决标签偏差导致的错误标记提供了有效工具，可提升数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Motivation: 当前图对比学习方法主要关注隐式语义关系，忽略了图中结构常识的重要性，导致表示学习效果受限。

Result: 实验表明，Str-GCL优于现有方法，为图表示学习提供了新视角。

Conclusion: Str-GCL首次将结构常识直接引入图对比学习，展示了其在提升表示学习效果中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Motivation: 解决LLM推理成本高和部署难度大的问题，尤其是在极低位（sub-3-bit）量化时面临的精度和效率下降挑战。

Method: 结合卷积码、混合编码和代码簇技术，构建无查找表的编码空间，实现权重向量与码本的线性映射，优化推理性能。

Conclusion: CCQ在极低位量化下显著降低模型大小，同时保持高精度和推理效率，为LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B

*Zixuan Huang,Kecheng Huang,Lihao Yin,Bowei He,Huiling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Zili Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Guard是一种基于注意力感知的GNN输入分类器，用于防御LLMs的多轮越狱攻击，通过构建实体图和注意力增强机制，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs经过严格训练，但仍易受多轮越狱攻击，现有方法难以检测和缓解此类攻击。

Method: 提出G-Guard，构建多轮查询的实体图，引入注意力感知增强机制，利用相似单轮查询增强分类能力。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效防御多轮越狱攻击，为LLMs安全性提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeMul的新方法，通过直接蒸馏LLM知识到提示中，避免了提取描述的步骤，提升了提示的语义丰富性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过LLM提取文本描述生成提示，但存在高变异性与低可靠性问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul)，直接蒸馏LLM知识到提示中，避免描述提取，并采用多提示加权机制。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过消除描述提取步骤，显著提升了提示学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CGFM的新方法，通过结合辅助模型的输出和流匹配技术，提升了时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在局限性，如固定的源分布和有限的采样路径，而流匹配技术提供了更快的生成和更高质量的输出。CGFM旨在充分利用流匹配的潜力，并通过学习辅助模型的错误进一步提升性能。

Method: CGFM扩展了流匹配技术，结合辅助模型的输出，构建双面条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在时间序列预测任务中表现优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过结合流匹配和辅助模型错误学习，显著提升了预测性能，为时间序列预测方法提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Weight Sharing Attention (WSA)的新架构，用于结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，以丰富强化学习中的状态表示，平衡效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习（RL）中，预训练模型的潜在嵌入信息未被充分利用，如何有效结合这些信息仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出WSA架构，通过注意力机制结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，形成更丰富的状态表示。

Result: 在多个Atari游戏中，WSA表现与端到端模型相当，并研究了模型数量对性能的影响。

Conclusion: WSA为结合预训练模型信息提供了一种有效方法，展示了其在强化学习中的潜力。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Motivation: 探讨神经网络是否能够系统性捕获离散、组合任务结构，尽管其本质是连续和分布式的。

Method: 通过扩大数据和模型规模，研究神经网络在不同任务编码下的组合泛化能力，并分析隐藏激活的线性解码能力。

Result: 研究发现，只要训练分布充分覆盖任务空间，标准多层感知器可以以线性神经元数量近似组合任务家族，且组合成分可从隐藏激活中线性解码。

Conclusion: 神经网络在足够的数据和模型规模下可以实现组合泛化，且其组合结构可通过隐藏激活线性解码，这与文本到图像生成模型的失败案例相关。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于低秩近似的可扩展方法，用于学习Koopman算子的前k个奇异函数，避免了数值不稳定的线性代数操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如VAMPnet和DPNet）在计算目标时涉及数值不稳定的操作（如奇异值分解和矩阵求逆），可能导致梯度估计偏差，且难以扩展到大型系统。

Method: 基于低秩近似，提出了一种简单且可扩展的方法，无需不稳定的线性代数操作，并易于集成到现代深度学习流程中。

Result: 实验结果表明，学习的奇异子空间在下游任务（如特征分析和多步预测）中既可靠又有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习Koopman算子的奇异函数提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE在校准和预测性能上优于单模型和简单集成基线。

Conclusion: 模型多样性有助于改进不确定性估计，MUSE提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线模型为评估机器学习在固体力学中的应用提供了标准化和挑战性的基准，推动了断裂力学研究的进展。

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Method: 在训练GPT-2架构时，对八种注意力机制进行基准测试，测量训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用和功耗等关键指标。

Result: 优化内核实现的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention和MLA）能效最佳；GPU功耗低并不一定减少总能耗，训练时间同样重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了能源意识基准测试在注意力设计中的重要性，并为选择资源高效机制提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Result: 实验表明，利用中间特征训练的代理模型显著提高了对抗攻击的可转移性。

Conclusion: 分布式深度学习系统设计需紧急考虑中间特征泄露的安全风险。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Method: 提出MM-TCN-CMA框架，整合IMU和雷达数据，利用跨模态注意力机制增强检测性能。

Result: 在多模态条件下，检测性能显著提升（F1-score提高4.3%-5.2%），在模态缺失时仍保持优势（F1-score提高1.3%-2.4%）。

Conclusion: MM-TCN-CMA是首个有效融合IMU和雷达数据的鲁棒多模态学习框架，为饮食监测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Result: 方法能够生成准确、可解释且可编辑的治疗动态模型，支持严格的因果分析和实际决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险领域提供了可验证、稳健且可解释的治疗效果动态分析工具。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Result: 在模拟数据和实际应用中验证了TRIP测试的可靠性。

Conclusion: TRIP测试能有效检测置换特征重要性的不可靠性，适用于高维数据。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Conclusion: ProbNES是一种高效的零阶局部优化算法，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Result: 实验表明，基于CVAE的检测方法在识别隐蔽对抗攻击方面显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了先进概率建模在提升IDS能力以应对基于生成模型的网络入侵中的重要性。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL算法有效优化了集群联邦学习的性能，提升了收敛速度和奖励。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少信息泄露并提升训练效率，适用于隐私保护的协作学习场景。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Motivation: LLMs在专业领域（如化学）中常生成看似合理但实际无效的信息，即“合理性-有效性差距”，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Magistral Small模型，通过LoRA微调，并创建标准化双领域数据集（涵盖分子性质和化学反应）。

Result: 微调模型在格式一致性、分子化学有效性及合成路线可行性上显著优于基线模型，但在立体化学等方面仍有局限。

Conclusion: 研究为将通用LLMs转化为可靠的化学研究工具提供了可行框架，并指出了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Result: 在四个节点分类基准上，准确率提升高达3%，同时增强了表示的几何解释性。

Conclusion: 几何感知的投影方法显著提升了预测性能，并使图表示更具可解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Motivation: 尽管DRL在多领域取得显著成功，但其策略在参数不同的评估环境中泛化能力有限。传统方法需要多样化的训练数据，但在实际应用中难以实现。

Result: 理论和实验证明，CEBE能近似多上下文训练的Q函数，CSE在确定性控制环境中表现高效。

Conclusion: CSE在仿真环境中验证了其提升DRL泛化能力的潜力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Result: 在多种因果推理和发现任务中，GO-CBED表现优于现有基线，特别是在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的情况下。

Conclusion: GO-CBED展示了将实验设计目标与具体研究目标对齐以及前瞻性序列规划的优势。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了奖励破解问题，并在OOD场景中表现出色，为奖励建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from

research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current

standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community

*Seonghyun Park,Kiyoung Seong,Soojung Yang,Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli,Sungsoo Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLC框架通过从生成模型的时间滞后条件中学习集体变量（CVs），解决了传统机器学习方法在捕捉慢动态行为方面的不足，并在Alanine Dipeptide系统中验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于分子动力学模拟难以直接观察罕见事件（如状态转换），需要增强采样技术。现有机器学习方法在CV发现中未能充分编码动态细节，因此提出TLC框架以改进。

Method: TLC通过建模时间滞后条件分布而非静态Boltzmann分布，学习CVs以捕捉慢动态行为。在Alanine Dipeptide系统中通过SMD和OPES任务验证。

Result: TLC在过渡路径采样和状态判别任务中表现优于或等同于现有MLCV方法。

Conclusion: TLC框架通过直接建模动态行为，显著提升了CVs的准确性，为增强采样提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HGMP的多任务提示框架，用于解决异构图神经网络中预训练与下游任务不匹配的问题，通过统一任务格式、对比预训练策略和特征提示提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练和微调方法在异构图神经网络中广泛应用，但存在预训练模型与下游任务不匹配的问题，导致性能不佳。提示学习方法为解决这一问题提供了新方向。

Method: 提出HGMP框架：1）统一下游任务为图级任务格式；2）设计图级对比预训练策略；3）引入异构图特征提示优化输入特征表示。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，HGMP能适应多种任务，并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HGMP通过多任务提示框架有效解决了异构图中的任务不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: 深度神经网络通过预训练在低维生成模型中自发表示信念，类似于贝叶斯更新，且不受架构限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络如何通过预训练自发形成对数据的低维生成模型的信念表示。

Method: 使用深度神经网络（如Transformer和RNN）进行预训练，分析其激活几何关系。

Result: 神经网络能够发现并表示低维生成模型的信念，且这种表示与架构无关。

Conclusion: 神经网络在预训练中自发形成对数据的低维生成模型的信念，具有普适性。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Result: 尽管许多应用仍处于原型阶段，但预计随着对GPMs兴趣的增加，这些应用将在未来几年成熟。

Conclusion: GPMs有望加速化学科学的转型，尤其是在处理复杂数据集方面。

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTME-MTL是一种动态令牌调制与扩展框架，通过识别令牌空间中的梯度冲突并应用自适应解决方案，提升多任务学习（MTL）的性能，同时避免参数过度增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中不同任务的目标差异可能导致负迁移，而现有动态网络架构效率低下。DTME-MTL旨在通过令牌空间的动态调整提升适应性和减少过拟合。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，识别令牌空间中的梯度冲突，并根据冲突类型应用自适应解决方案，避免直接转换共享参数为任务特定参数。

Result: 实验表明，DTME-MTL能显著提升多任务性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为基于Transformer的多任务学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 比较了不同分类器在脑机接口（BCI）中的不确定性量化能力，发现CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性估计上表现最佳，而深度学习模型在分类准确性上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同分类器在BCI中的不确定性量化能力，以提高分类的可靠性和准确性。

Method: 比较了CSP-LDA、MDRM、深度学习模型（Deep Ensembles、Direct Uncertainty Quantification）和标准CNN的不确定性量化能力。

Result: CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性估计上表现最佳，深度学习模型在分类准确性上更优。所有模型都能区分简单和困难样本。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝模糊样本，可以提高BCI的准确性，CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性量化上表现突出。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCV框架结合PVGs和CBMs，用于高维数据的可解释非线性分类，表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PVGs未应用于复杂高维数据（如图像）和CBMs依赖低容量线性预测器的局限性。

Method: 利用概念发现模型提取结构化概念编码，由证明者选择子集，验证者（非线性预测器）用于决策。

Result: NCV在高维复杂数据集上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器，并减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV是迈向高性能、可验证AI的重要一步。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于高维多变量时间序列数据，具有高效和内存友好的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的兴起，实时异常检测需求激增，需要处理高维流数据且无需存储历史实例的方法。

Method: DAD通过单次遍历动态学习数据的相关结构，避免传统方法处理完整数据或窗口实例的负担。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上，DAD表现出最一致且优越的性能，尤其在高维数据流中表现稳健。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得了最佳平衡，为实时、内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式Gram矩阵计算和逆运算，导致数值不稳定，影响近似质量或产生奇异矩阵。

Method: 采用无逆正则化框架，基于稳定分解，解决了GPU内存不足、输入激活矩阵接近奇异和数据不足等问题。

Result: 方法在数值稳定性上优于现有技术，并能处理多种挑战性场景，同时提供了收敛性和误差界限的理论保证。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了低秩近似的数值稳定性和适用性，适用于大规模神经网络的压缩与微调。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于元学习的新型框架，用于优化条件切换（CHO），在动态信号条件下性能优于3GPP基准180%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动网络复杂性和小区规模减小，传统切换面临延迟和失败增加的问题，条件切换（CHO）虽能缓解但引入新挑战。

Method: 采用O-RAN范式，利用元学习优化CHO，解决资源分配和信令开销问题。

Result: 在动态信号条件下，性能比3GPP基准至少提升180%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为CHO优化提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了切换性能。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法为职业转换提供了新的自动化路径，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，SLOGAN显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过因果特征分离和动态干预，有效解决了图域适应中的分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在EEG数据上泛化能力差，主要由于受试者间的高变异性，需要开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，采用深度卷积分词器生成通道特定特征，结合Transformer编码器进行特征混合。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在帕金森病检测中表现出更一致、更可靠的结果，显著降低了变异性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合联邦分割学习（FSL）与Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构，解决了传统联邦学习的单点故障和隐私问题，同时提升了扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感领域中，传统的联邦学习存在单点故障和隐私风险，而分割学习扩展性差，需要一种既能保护隐私又能高效扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用FSL与HLF结合的方式，利用HLF的瞬时字段和私有数据集合（PDCs）实现去中心化的模型执行和聚合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL达到了与集中式FSL相当的精度，同时减少了每轮训练时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和扩展性上表现出色，证明了其在企业级应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

*Darshan Makwana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限宽度全连接ReLU网络中逐层有效维度（特征矩阵的秩），推导了随机高斯权重下隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，发现秩的几何衰减现象，并揭示了秩的振荡行为是有限宽度现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReLU网络中隐藏层的秩行为，以理解输入变化子空间的动态特性，补充现有关于深度网络表达性的研究。

Method: 固定输入批次，使用随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并分析其几何衰减和振荡行为。

Result: 发现秩以几何比率衰减，并在特定深度出现局部极大值；正交权重初始化或强负斜率Leaky-ReLU可保持秩接近满秩。

Conclusion: 揭示了随机ReLU层对输入变化子空间的交替压缩和部分恢复行为，为深度网络的表达性提供了新的理解。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: FedCBDR提出了一种联邦类增量学习中的类平衡数据重放方法，通过全局协调机制和任务感知温度缩放模块解决类不平衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦类增量学习中，数据重放方法因类不平衡问题（包括重放缓冲区内和任务间的不平衡）而性能受限。

Method: FedCBDR包含两个关键模块：1）全局视角数据重放模块，通过隐私保护方式重构全局表示并实现平衡采样；2）任务感知温度缩放模块，动态调整温度以减少对多数类的过自信。

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过类平衡和任务感知机制，有效解决了联邦类增量学习中的类不平衡问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以全面检测LLM的漏洞，尤其是在处理有害内容生成方面。

Method: 引入GuardVal协议，动态生成和优化越狱提示，并提出防止优化停滞的新方法。

Result: 应用于多种模型（如Mistral-7b和GPT-4），揭示了不同模型的行为模式和安全性差异。

Conclusion: GuardVal为LLM安全性评估提供了更全面的方法，并为未来安全模型开发提供了见解。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的机器遗忘方法OPC，通过特征表示的一点收缩实现深度遗忘，解决了现有方法浅层遗忘的问题，并验证了其对抗性能恢复和梯度反转攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法仅通过调整模型响应实现浅层遗忘，内部表征仍保留信息，无法满足隐私、法律或伦理需求。

Method: 定义基于特征表示一点收缩的深度遗忘理论标准，提出高效近似算法OPC，实现深度特征遗忘。

Result: OPC在图像分类遗忘任务中表现出色，有效对抗性能恢复和梯度反转攻击。

Conclusion: OPC的深度遗忘特性强调了机器遗忘方法需提升鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多任务神经网络方法，用于估计随机实验中的分布处理效应（DTE），解决了传统方法在数据不平衡和计算效率上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如平均处理效应（ATE）无法提供实验结果的细粒度洞察，而DTE的估计面临数据不平衡和计算效率低的挑战。

Method: 利用多任务神经网络估计条件结果分布，结合单调形状约束和多阈值标签学习以提高准确性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集（如节水实验和流媒体平台A/B测试）中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代因果推断应用提供了稳健且实用的解决方案，尤其适用于需要详细理解处理效应异质性的场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在未见目标域中的泛化问题，特别是在多任务场景下，传统测试时训练方法因任务行为不同步而表现不佳。

Result: S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有测试时训练方法。

Conclusion: S4T通过同步多任务处理，显著提升了测试时训练在多任务场景下的性能。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX是一种特征感知的对抗训练框架，通过自适应分配不同强度的对抗样本，减少类别间的鲁棒性差异，提升整体防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法对所有类别采用统一目标，忽略了类别间脆弱性差异，导致对抗不公平。强类别更鲁棒，弱类别更易受攻击。

Method: TRIX为强类别分配较弱的目标对抗样本以促进特征多样性，为弱类别分配较强的非目标对抗样本以增强其鲁棒性，并结合损失加权和扰动强度调整。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，TRIX显著提升了最差类别在干净和对抗数据上的准确率，减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，并保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是迈向公平有效对抗防御的实用步骤。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Conclusion: 通过平方根参数化方法，成功解决了自然梯度变分推断的收敛性问题，为相关研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Conclusion: 新方法通过优化状态空间数据分布，显著提升了训练效果和模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Conclusion: SAMVAE为肿瘤学中的生存分析提供了可解释、数据驱动的方法，支持更明智的临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常在训练或编译时应用，依赖结构化稀疏性，未能充分利用无SIMD支持设备的细粒度效率。

Method: UnIT通过输入特定的激活模式动态识别并跳过不必要的MAC操作，将剪枝决策转化为轻量级比较，并优化计算。

Conclusion: UnIT证明了无结构推理时剪枝是一种高效、无需重新训练的实用解决方案，适用于MCU上的深度神经网络部署。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings

existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution

Conclusion: 提出的不等式在改进估计和风险界限方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Motivation: 现有表格数据基准很少包含文本列，且难以找到具有丰富语义文本特征的真实数据集。

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）的隐私、版权和数据管理风险日益突出，现有技术依赖高资源和精心设计的提示，本文旨在开发一种更简单、更普遍的攻击方法。

Method: 基于领域知识，利用电子商务平台抓取的数据中模板化布局和图像与模式化提示的关联，设计了一种低资源攻击方法。

Result: 发现某些看似无害的提示（如“蓝色Unisex T-Shirt”）能重建真实人类模型的面部图像，表明风险可能被无意触发。

Conclusion: 生成模型存在潜在的数据重建风险，即使是普通用户也可能无意中触发，需进一步研究防范措施。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

Motivation: 探讨预训练AI模型在填补缺失协变量时对决策过程遗憾的影响，并提出统一的理论框架。

Method: 引入“模型弹性”概念，结合正交统计学习和双重稳健回归技术校准预训练模型。

Result: 在MAR设置下，校准预训练模型显著提升填补协变量的质量，改善遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 模型弹性可作为评估预训练模型在数据驱动决策中集成效果的基本指标，具有广泛实用价值。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线数据如何有效用于在线学习中的探索和样本效率问题。

Method: 将动作分块技术应用于基于时间差分（TD）的强化学习方法，直接在分块动作空间中进行RL。

Result: 在长时程稀疏奖励任务中，Q-chunking表现出优于现有方法的离线性能和在线样本效率。

Conclusion: Q-chunking通过动作分块技术显著提升了离线到在线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 中小企业（SMEs）对现代经济至关重要，但其信用风险分析常因数据稀缺而受限，尤其是缺乏直接信用记录的在线贷款机构。

Method: 采用图神经网络（GNN）框架，通过分析中小企业的交易和社交数据，构建空间依赖关系以预测贷款违约风险。

Result: 在真实数据集（Discover和Ant Credit）上测试，GNN在供应链挖掘和违约预测中的AUC分别达到0.995和0.701，优于传统方法和其他GNN基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为中小企业信用风险评估提供了可扩展且有效的工具，并为监管机构提供了供应链中断对银行影响的建模数据。

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

Motivation: 理解DPO的通用原理对于其在多样化的应用场景中的使用至关重要，同时也有助于识别其局限性和改进方法。

Method: 通过建立Savage损失函数与随机选择理论之间的联系，支持了包括弃权、非凸目标等特性，并扩展了DPO的设置。

Result: 研究证明了DPO的通用性，能够涵盖多种扩展场景（如边界和长度校正），并揭示了其与现有变体的关系。

Conclusion: DPO的通用视角不仅有助于理解其工作原理，还为未来的改进和扩展提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ApexOracle是一种AI模型，能预测现有化合物的抗菌效力并设计新型分子，以对抗新型病原体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗生素耐药性（AMR）日益严重，现有方法无法快速识别有效分子对抗新型病原体或耐药菌株。

Method: ApexOracle结合分子特征和病原体特异性上下文，通过离散扩散语言模型和双嵌入框架整合基因组和文献数据。

Result: ApexOracle在活性预测和新型病原体适应性方面优于现有方法，并能设计高效新型分子。

Conclusion: ApexOracle为对抗AMR和未来传染病爆发提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Conclusion: EXPO通过结合表达性策略和动态优化，有效解决了表达性策略在在线RL中的稳定性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

TL;DR: SAMO是一种轻量级的多任务优化方法，通过结合全局和局部扰动，有效缓解多任务学习中的任务冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中的任务冲突限制了模型性能，而SAM（锐度感知最小化）能缓解冲突，但如何结合全局和局部信息以及降低计算开销是关键挑战。

Method: 提出SAMO方法，利用联合的全局-局部扰动，通过仅前向传递近似局部扰动并进行层归一化以提高效率。

Result: 在多个多任务基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SAMO通过轻量化设计成功解决了任务冲突问题，提升了多任务学习的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型（LMs）近年来取得了巨大进步，但预处理步骤（如分词）仍然是实现真正端到端基础模型的障碍。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合显式层次网络（H-Net），实现完全端到端学习。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的Transformer模型，多级层次结构进一步提升了性能，尤其在中文、代码和DNA序列等弱分词场景下表现更优。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了端到端模型在处理未处理数据时的潜力，能够更好地学习和扩展。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Result: 75%正确预测样本可缩短路径提升效率；60%错误预测样本可通过CoLa修正结果。

Conclusion: 固定架构的预训练模型存在不足，动态深度调整能显著提升推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

### [139] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合符号推理与自适应控制的统一代理框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）实现离散故障恢复规划和连续过程控制，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化学过程日益复杂，劳动力短缺和故障场景多样化，需要新的自动化范式来结合符号推理与自适应控制。

Method: 采用有限状态机（FSMs）作为可解释的操作框架，通过LLM驱动的规划代理提出恢复序列，模拟代理执行和检查每个转换，验证-重新提示循环迭代优化无效计划。

Result: 在案例研究中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在180个随机生成的FSMs中实现了100%的有效路径成功率，并在实验室平台上表现出与经典PID控制相似的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs可以统一高层符号规划和低层连续控制，为化学工程中的弹性语言驱动自动化铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BOOST的新方法，通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，解决AI艺术分类中的偏差问题，并在KaoKore和PACS数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI艺术分类中的偏差问题日益严重，尤其是在处理分布外数据时，现有方法未能充分解决这一问题。

Method: 提出BOOST方法，动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，以平衡类别表示。

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上，BOOST显著减少了类别偏差，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: BOOST是一种有效的解决方案，能够在艺术领域平衡AI模型的公平性和性能。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在动态游戏交互中表现良好，但在规则驱动的交易系统中容易出现规则违反问题，如物品幻觉和计算错误，损害玩家信任。

Method: 提出State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP)，将交易分解为六个状态，通过上下文感知的物品引用和占位符价格计算实现规则遵守。

Result: 在100个交易对话中，SIBP实现了>97%的状态合规性、>95%的引用准确性和99.7%的计算精度，计算效率高且优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SIBP为商业游戏中可信赖的NPC交互提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链网络复杂且涉及非法活动时分析困难，传统机器学习需要大量训练数据，但非法供应链数据稀疏且不可靠。

Method: 采用神经符号方法，提出基于问题树的LLM查询方法，自动提取新闻文章特征，并与人工分类对比。

Result: 系统评估了人工与机器分类新闻文章的差异，量化了文章相关性。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法和问题树LLM查询能有效检测供应链非法活动，弥补数据稀疏和不可靠的挑战。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents

workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译代理通常仅支持文本输入，无法利用多模态信息，限制了翻译的准确性和适应性。

Method: ViDove借鉴人类翻译工作流程，整合多模态记忆系统和长短时记忆模块，结合领域知识提升翻译效果。

Result: ViDove在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中表现优异，BLEU分数提升28%，SubER提升15%。

Conclusion: ViDove通过多模态输入显著提升翻译质量，并推出新基准DoveBench，为视频字幕翻译提供高质量数据。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成有害内容的过滤问题，发现输入和输出过滤均存在计算上的挑战，并指出外部过滤器无法完全确保安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其可能被滥用于生成有害内容的问题日益突出，研究旨在探讨如何通过过滤技术解决这一对齐挑战。

Method: 研究分析了输入提示和输出内容的过滤效率，通过计算复杂性理论和密码学假设，证明了过滤的局限性。

Result: 发现对抗性提示可以绕过高效过滤器，且输出过滤在特定情况下计算上不可行，表明外部过滤器无法完全保障安全。

Conclusion: 安全性不能仅依赖外部过滤器，需将判断能力融入LLMs内部，智能与判断不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验表明，Sim-to-Dec显著提高准时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec满足多场景泛化、细粒度动态模拟、历史与预测结合及反馈紧密集成的需求。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在科学领域（如药物发现）中推理能力受限的问题，克服传统方法的高计算成本或数据利用不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出DrugMCTS框架，整合RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过五个专用智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，实现结构化迭代推理。

Result: 在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上，DrugMCTS的召回率和鲁棒性显著优于通用LLM和深度学习基线，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct性能提升超20%。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对推进LLM在药物发现中的应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Motivation: 现有基准测试很少同时评估生产活动和社会互动能力，StarDojo旨在填补这一空白。

Method: StarDojo包含1000个任务，分为五个关键领域，并提供100个代表性任务的子集。它提供统一、用户友好的界面，支持多环境并行执行。

Result: 当前最先进的MLLM代理表现有限，最佳模型GPT-4.1的成功率仅为12.7%，主要因视觉理解、多模态推理和低级操作挑战。

Conclusion: StarDojo旨在促进复杂生产生活环境中稳健、开放式代理的进一步研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: 规则模型在高风险应用中需谨慎使用，以避免负面解释问题。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的方法，显著提升了GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的性能。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief
and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust
uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

TL;DR: PlanQA是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）几何和空间推理能力的诊断基准，基于室内场景的结构化表示，揭示了LLMs在真实世界布局推理中的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在几何和空间推理方面的能力，尤其是对物理约束和空间一致性的处理，以发现其在实际应用中的局限性。

Method: 通过结构化表示（如JSON、XML）编码室内场景，设计多样化问题类型，测试度量、拓扑推理及设计约束。

Result: LLMs在浅层查询中表现良好，但在模拟物理约束、保持空间一致性或布局扰动下的泛化能力上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了LLMs在真实世界布局推理中的不足，为未来研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

TL;DR: 本文分析了直接偏好优化（DPO）的理论局限，提出了一种双层优化框架——稳定偏好优化，以改进模型对齐的稳定性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO在语言模型对齐中表现高效但理论性质未充分研究，其敏感性和概率分配问题可能影响模型对齐效果。

Method: 提出双层优化框架，结合监督微调和增强的DPO目标，引入正则化方案以稳定优化动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理和摘要任务中优于标准DPO，提高了推理准确性和对齐一致性。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标设计提供了新思路，推动了更可靠、可解释的语言模型对齐。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于轮廓线分类小提琴是否为缩小版的方法，通过几何特征分析，发现区分缩小与非缩小版小提琴是可行的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于量化分析小提琴轮廓线差异，填补专家观察未定量研究的空白。

Method: 方法包括通过摄影测量获取25把小提琴的3D几何网格，提取10-20条轮廓线，拟合抛物线曲线并计算参数，最终生成数值化特征。

Result: 结果显示几何特征可以一定程度区分缩小与非缩小版小提琴，其中开口参数beta最具预测性。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法可行，但需考虑存在部分难以量化的过渡形态小提琴。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估聚焦技术能力或避免伤害，而FAI Benchmark旨在衡量AI对人类全面繁荣的贡献。

Method: 通过1229个主客观问题，结合专家LLM和几何平均评分，评估28个语言模型。

Result: 最高分模型72/100，但无模型在所有维度表现良好，尤其在信仰、品德和意义维度。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark为开发支持人类繁荣的AI提供了框架，对AI伦理和评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型需要大量训练数据和复杂优化，而MoSE通过模仿人类驾驶员的学习过程，提出技能导向的路由机制，以更高效的方式提升自动驾驶系统的泛化和解释能力。

Method: MoSE采用技能导向的路由机制，定义并标注特定技能，构建分层技能数据集，并通过单次前向推理整合辅助任务（如描述、推理、规划），无需额外计算成本。

Result: MoSE在CODA AD角点推理任务中优于多个8B+参数模型，激活模型规模减少至少62.5%，性能达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向设计和单次推理，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的效率和性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI依赖大规模模型和数据集，导致环境、经济和伦理成本高昂，缺乏可持续性和公平性。受生物感官系统启发，提出自适应感知以解决这些问题。

Method: 通过动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置）来优化输入，减少协变量偏移并提升效率。

Result: 实证研究表明，自适应感知使小模型（如EfficientNet-B0）性能超过更大模型（如OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 论文提出将自适应感知广泛应用于实际场景，并探讨技术、伦理挑战及未来研究方向，推动可持续、鲁棒和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Method: 提出了一组算法，具有多项式复杂度和可调精度，用于识别实际原因。

Result: 实验表明，算法能处理现有方法无法应对的系统（如非布尔、黑盒和随机系统），且可通过调整计算时间提高精度和全面性。

Conclusion: 该算法为解决实际原因识别问题提供了实用且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Conclusion: 该研究为智能法律辅助系统提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Result: 研究发现，即使资源丰富的公司能更快扩展模型，其能力优势也将逐渐消失，弱小模型将接近最佳性能。

Conclusion: AI战略和政策需重新审视，以适应弱小模型能力提升的趋势，并应对相关影响。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Abstract: The work involved in gathering, wrangling, cleaning, and otherwise preparing
data for analysis is often the most time consuming and tedious aspect of data
work. Although many studies describe data preparation within the context of
data science workflows, there has been little research on data preparation in
data journalism. We address this gap with a hybrid form of thematic analysis
that combines deductive codes derived from existing accounts of data science
workflows and inductive codes arising from an interview study with 36
professional data journalists. We extend a previous model of data science work
to incorporate detailed activities of data preparation. We synthesize 60 dirty
data issues from 16 taxonomies on dirty data and our interview data, and we
provide a novel taxonomy to characterize these dirty data issues as
discrepancies between mental models. We also identify four challenges faced by
journalists: diachronic, regional, fragmented, and disparate data sources.

Conclusion: \flora Engine为AI增强学习环境提供了有效的理论和实践支持，推动了SRL和HHAIRL的发展。

Abstract: SRL, defined as learners' ability to systematically plan, monitor, and
regulate their learning activities, is crucial for sustained academic
achievement and lifelong learning competencies. Emerging Artificial
Intelligence (AI) developments profoundly influence SRL interactions by
potentially either diminishing or strengthening learners' opportunities to
exercise their own regulatory skills. Recent literature emphasizes a balanced
approach termed Hybrid Human-AI Regulated Learning (HHAIRL), in which AI
provides targeted, timely scaffolding while preserving the learners' role as
active decision-makers and reflective monitors of their learning process.
Nevertheless, existing digital tools frequently fall short, lacking
adaptability, focusing narrowly on isolated SRL phases, and insufficiently
support meaningful human-AI interactions. In response, this paper introduces
the enhanced \flora Engine, which incorporates advanced Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) features and state-of-the-art learning analytics,
explicitly grounded in SRL and HHAIRL theories. The \flora Engine offers
instrumentation tools such as collaborative writing, multi-agents chatbot, and
detailed learning trace logging to support dynamic, adaptive scaffolding
tailored to individual needs in real time. We further present a summary of
several research studies that provide the validations for and illustrate how
these instrumentation tools can be utilized in real-world educational and
experimental contexts. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of \flora
Engine in fostering SRL and HHAIRL, providing both theoretical insights and
practical solutions for the future of AI-enhanced learning context.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

Abstract: Human and automation capabilities are the foundation of every human-autonomy
interaction and interaction pattern. Therefore, machines need to understand the
capacity and performance of human doing, and adapt their own behavior,
accordingly. In this work, we address the concept of conjugated capabilities,
i.e. capabilities that are dependent or interrelated and between which effort
can be distributed. These may be used to overcome human limitations, by
shifting effort from a deficient to a conjugated capability with performative
resources. For example: A limited arm's reach may be compensated by tilting the
torso forward. We analyze the interrelation between elementary capabilities
within the IMBA standard to uncover potential conjugation, and show evidence in
data of post-rehabilitation patients. From the conjugated capabilities, within
the example application of stationary manufacturing, we create a network of
interrelations. With this graph, a manifold of potential uses is enabled. We
showcase the graph's usage in optimizing IMBA test design to accelerate data
recordings, and discuss implications of conjugated capabilities on task
allocation between the human and an autonomy.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了专家对商业AI公开演讲训练工具的看法，支持混合模式结合传统教练与AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开演讲是重要技能，但传统培训依赖专家，AI工具的商业应用研究不足。

Method: 通过16次半结构化访谈和2个焦点小组收集专家意见。

Result: 专家认可AI工具处理重复性任务的价值，但指出需改进反馈个性化和设计。

Conclusion: 支持混合模式，结合AI与传统教练，提升工具设计。

Abstract: Background: Public speaking is a vital professional skill, yet it remains a
source of significant anxiety for many individuals. Traditional training relies
heavily on expert coaching, but recent advances in AI has led to novel types of
commercial automated public speaking feedback tools. However, most research has
focused on prototypes rather than commercial applications, and little is known
about how public speaking experts perceive these tools.
  Objectives: This study aims to evaluate expert opinions on the efficacy and
design of commercial AI-based public speaking training tools and to propose
guidelines for their improvement.
  Methods: The research involved 16 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus
groups with public speaking experts. Participants discussed their views on
current commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional
coaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.
  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in
handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus
on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools,
emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected
feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model
combining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.
