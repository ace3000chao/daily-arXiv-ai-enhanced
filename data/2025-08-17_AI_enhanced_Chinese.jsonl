Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower\nincoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not\nwidely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for\nteaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete\nspatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has\ndeveloped or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:\nWe seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both\nin isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to\ntraditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing\npencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time\nfeedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with\n$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative\nspatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated\nassessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We\nalso compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using\ndata collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took\nour VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no\nsignificant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120\nminutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes\neach), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR.\nWe observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most\nstudents reported enjoying learning in VR.", "AI": {"tldr": "VR\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6548\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30VR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7eb8\u8d28\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u7f16\u4e3aVR\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u652f\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "VR\u8bfe\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u77ed\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u53cd\u9988\u79ef\u6781\u3002", "conclusion": "VR\u662f\u6559\u6388\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u4e14\u66f4\u7701\u65f6\u3002"}}

To address this, Amazon\nlaunched the Trusted AI track of the Amazon Nova AI Challenge, a global\ncompetition among 10 university teams to drive advances in secure AI. In the\nchallenge, five teams focus on developing automated red teaming bots, while the\nother five create safe AI assistants. This challenge provides teams with a\nunique platform to evaluate automated red-teaming and safety alignment methods\nthrough head-to-head adversarial tournaments where red teams have multi-turn\nconversations with the competing AI coding assistants to test their safety\nalignment. Along with this, the challenge provides teams with a feed of high\nquality annotated data to fuel iterative improvement.

The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to\nsupport the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based\nmetric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to\nquantify mental effort. A design experiment is conducted with 32 participants,\nwhere they have to perform one control task and 2 focus tasks corresponding to\nthe motion exploration task (MET) and the concept generation task (CGT),\nrespectively. EEG data is recorded during the 3 tasks, cleaned, processed and\nanalysed using the MNE library in Python. It is observed from the results that\ninter-BRPD captures the essence of mental effort with half the number of\nconventionally used parameters.

There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and\naccuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,\nTemporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on\npublic data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show\nthat ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or\neven improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,\nthe main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of\nforecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u9700\u6c42\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6bd4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u6c42\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u66f4\u770b\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8ffd\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u589e\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u6ce2\u52a8\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9ML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u547c\u5401\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding.

However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive\ncomputation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient\nreasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token\nbudgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and\nreliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify\nthat encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to\nits solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise\nreward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of\nintermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and\nnaturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and\nAIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++.

Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

The samples were compared for the\nnumber of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding\nlocal minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has\nbeen achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the\nfailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement\nwhen using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential\nfor improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8c37\uff08LV\uff09\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30D-Wave\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u673a\uff08RBM\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178Gibbs\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u8c37\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u5728RBM\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178Gibbs\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528D-Wave\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u548c\u7ecf\u5178Gibbs\u91c7\u6837\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684RBM\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c40\u90e8\u8c37\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "result": "D-Wave\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u8c37\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u7565\u4f18\u4e8eGibbs\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8c37\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u91cd\u53e0\u8f83\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "D-Wave\u91c7\u6837\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RBM\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data.

We argue that any meaningful\njudgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally\ndepends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona\n(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test\nwhether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses\nhuman-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,\nchallenging models to determine the correct persona according to the\nconversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even\nthe best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level\nneeded for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near\nceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still\nnot human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand\nthis gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting\nthat reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends\non strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators.

In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture.

Moreover,\nexisting methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating\nknowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication\noverhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We\naddresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed\nto enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight\nchain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple\nreasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most\npromising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while\nproviding valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical\napplications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved\naggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating\nclient classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse\nclients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that\nFedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent\nresource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCoT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "method": "FedCoT\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u7d27\u51d1\u5224\u522b\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCoT\u5728\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCoT\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,\nreward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,\nhigh-performance language model adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RTTC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73TTC\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TTC\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982TTT\u548cRAG\uff09\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u5e94\u7528\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "RTTC\u7ed3\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRTTC\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RTTC\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TTC\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, we\ntake a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains\n154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale\nanalysis of how people respond to AI-generated content.

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.

Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters.

To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\n$\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values\nare similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce\nXQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for\nextreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to\n10$\\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01\nperplexity degradation, and 12.5$\\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$\nperplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute\ncapabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while\nsurpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving\nnear-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.", "AI": {"tldr": "XQuant\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "XQuant\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u7f13\u5b58\u5c42\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3bX\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u6784Keys\u548cValues\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002XQuant-CL\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "XQuant\u5b9e\u73b07.7\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u635f\u5931<0.1\uff1bXQuant-CL\u8fbe10\u500d\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4ec50.01\u3002", "conclusion": "XQuant\u5229\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6d88\u9664\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1FP16\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

This paper introduces Semantic Divergence\nMetrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness\nHallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input\ncontexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we\ntest for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not\nonly across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent\nparaphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint\nclustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts\nand answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,\n$\\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein\ndistance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a\nFaithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence\nKL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \\textbf{Semantic\nExploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.\nThese metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic\nframework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,\nconfident confabulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6SDM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u79bb\uff08Faithfulness Hallucinations\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u751f\u6210\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u6216\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fconfabulations\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79bb\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u56de\u7b54\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u9898\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u56fe\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa$\\mathcal{S}_H$\u8bc4\u5206\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Semantic Box\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "SDM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u7684Faithfulness Hallucinations\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial\nrevisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in\nfostering inclusive narratives.

In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified\nmodels. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern\nsystems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,\nWikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,\nproducing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The\nbest-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that\nexisting evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson\ncorrelation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that\nachieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IdiomEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6587\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982GPT-4\u548cGoogle\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u5728\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe28%\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u6587\u6210\u8bed\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u56e0\u5176\u6bd4\u55bb\u610f\u4e49\u4e0e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6b64\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaIdiomEval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8900\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982GPT-4\u548cGoogle\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u548c4\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7cfb\u7edfGPT-4\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e3a28%\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff08Pearson<0.48\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.68\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6587\u6210\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for\ndecadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline\nthat assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a\nyear held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq\n0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding\ncorroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns\nfrom historical data that are significant for projecting future change.\nFinally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on\nphysical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of\ndifferent scenarios by means of driver variables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08GenAI\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5341\u5e74\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u6c34\u5730\u8868\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u65e0\u53d8\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u533a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u22650.7\u00d70.7km\u00b2\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u53d8\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

The proposed software framework for\nmachine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data\nsets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.\nAlthough machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many\nproblems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples\nfor the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient\nnumber of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is\nchallenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.\nTherefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of\nantennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data\nsets.

Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,\nachieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\\times$ speedup on GSM8K,\nand up to 276.67$\\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9002\u7528\u4e8edLLMs\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLMs\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0cdLLMs\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u4f4d\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316dLLMs\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u63d0\u534717.29%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u52a0\u901f4.12\u500d\uff0cMMLU\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f276.67\u500d\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ICE\u4e3adLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u539f\u4f4d\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Based on this\ncausal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along\nwith a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only\nachieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly\nenhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover\nlearns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a\nresource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides\nformal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of\nProbably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover\nand Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that\nare {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean\nSquared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover\narbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this\nis detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with\nprobability {\\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's\nworkload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must\nperform, scales only as O(1/{\\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset\nsize. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any\nlinear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them\nbroadly applicable to various attribution tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f52\u56e0\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65b9\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684Prover\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684Verifier\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8bae\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0cVerifier\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
