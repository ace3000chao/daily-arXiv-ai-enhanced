This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the\nextension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging\nbut very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides\na straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network\nessentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for\nalgorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with\nlogarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By\napplying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the\nfirst time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,\nand modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,\nmodality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and\nLKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and\ndeception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there\nare deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single\npopulation, can efficiently maintain diversity.

However, most existing methods still require\nexternal data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,\nwhich can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit\nhypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization\ncapabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous\npersonalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which\nleverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding\nvectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's\nheterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we\nintroduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with\nsimilar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose\nMH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve\ngeneralization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not\nrequire disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced\nprivacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model\nsettings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong\ngeneralization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in\nmodel-heterogeneous personalized federated learning."}

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the\noptimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

RCR-AF\nuniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient\nstability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable\nmonotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity\nthrough built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\\alpha$\nand $\\gamma$.

To\nmeaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric\nthat takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a\npair of decision trees.

Differentially private stochastic\ngradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a\npronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,\ndegrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been\nproposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control\nknobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization\nlandscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy\nbudget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay\nwithin privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP\noptimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep\nreinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the\nlearning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter\ngradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian\nnoise.

G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat\nproduct features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.
