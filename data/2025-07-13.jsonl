In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with\nstructured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic\nplanningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,\nlanguage-driven automation in chemical engineering."}

While prior research has made\nstrides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the\ncritical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more\nrobust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on\nbiased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive\nsampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It\naddresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and\nsampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of\nall classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias.

Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high\ncomputational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor\ncounts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest\nPath for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node\nencodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first\napplies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the\nshortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting\nsequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP\nto capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational\nefficiency.

While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold.

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks.

These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples.

RL agents do not have\nany prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an\nend-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent\nworks, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational\nModels. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of\ndifferent pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and\nunderstudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),\na new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to\nshape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between\nefficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several\ncombination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple\nAtari games compared to end-to-end models.

In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs.

This\nconcept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model\nimputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More\nsurprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is\npossible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from\northogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration\nsignificantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much\nbetter regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having\nan accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests\nthat model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and\nimproving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven\ndecision-making problems."}

This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings.

Training\nexpressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable\nvalue maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online\nRL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are\nparameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient\npropagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some\nvalue function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value\nmaximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive\npolicy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We\npropose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL\nalgorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two\nparameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable\nimitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits\nthe actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.\nThe on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the\nlearned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and\nedited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup.

We found that the layers of a pretrained large\nlanguage model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better\nand even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each\nlayer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple\ntimes as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary\norders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space\ngreatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained\nmodules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample\nfrom math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a\nfixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same\nlayer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic\narchitectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the\nMCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples\nwith correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,\nsuggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of\nsamples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving\ncorrect predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement.
