*Yimeng Zhang,Tian Wang,Jiri Gesi,Ziyi Wang,Yuxuan Lu,Jiacheng Lin,Sinong Zhan,Vianne Gao,Ruochen Jiao,Junze Liu,Kun Qian,Yuxin Tang,Ran Xue,Houyu Zhang,Qingjun Cui,Yufan Guo,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1是一个强化学习框架，通过分阶段生成理由和预测行为，提升LLM在在线购物环境中模拟人类行为的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于生成理由的模型的推理能力，Shop-R1旨在通过强化学习增强LLM的推理能力。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和行为预测两阶段，分别使用自监督和分层奖励结构。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比基线性能提升了65%以上。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过强化学习显著提升了LLM在模拟人类行为中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

### [2] [Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17849)
*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DG-PRM提出了一种动态且可泛化的过程奖励建模方法，通过奖励树和多维奖励标准，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，泛化能力差，且LLM-as-judge研究忽视了文本中的指导信息，静态评估标准难以适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度多维奖励标准，动态选择奖励信号，并首次使用Pareto优势估计处理多面奖励信号。

Result: 实验显示DG-PRM在主流基准上表现优异，显著提升模型性能，并展现出良好的分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM为复杂任务中的过程奖励建模提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，用于检测和减轻自然语言数据库接口中的认知偏差，通过上下文语义映射、Hard-to-Vary原则和优化的LLM提示生成，显著提升了分析质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助缺乏统计背景的用户在自然语言数据库接口中避免认知偏差，提出无偏见的分析问题。

Method: 引入上下文语义映射框架、Hard-to-Vary原则分析框架，以及优化的LLM提示生成系统。

Result: 82.5%的用户认为系统提升了分析质量；在比较评估中，VeriMinder在具体性、全面性和准确性上至少优于其他方法20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder有效解决了“错误问题”漏洞，其开源代码和框架有望推动进一步研究和社区应用。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的端到端自动口语评估方法，使用单一Whisper-small编码器处理多部分口语测试，减少了推理时间和模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模计算机辅助语言学习系统中自动口语评估的效率和实用性问题。

Method: 使用Whisper-small编码器处理所有口语响应，通过轻量级聚合器整合信息并预测最终分数。

Result: 系统RMSE为0.384，优于文本基线（0.44），且仅需44.8%的语料库数据进行训练即可达到0.383 RMSE。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且数据利用率高，适用于大规模语言学习系统。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了六种AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，发现不同工具在对抗攻击（如改写和人化）下的表现差异显著，其中Few-shot和CoT提示方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补文献中关于DeepSeek模型检测能力的空白，并评估对抗攻击对AI检测工具的影响。

Method: 使用六种AI检测工具测试DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，并应用改写和人化等对抗攻击。同时，采用Few-shot和CoT提示方法评估DeepSeek作为检测器的表现。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始和改写文本上表现优异，而人化攻击显著降低了检测准确率。Few-shot和CoT提示方法表现最佳，准确率达96%以上。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对AI检测工具的准确性有显著影响，Few-shot和CoT提示方法为有效的检测手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能在上下文中根据证据更一致地遵循贝叶斯定理更新信念，以理解模型的能力和局限性。

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致性系数（BCC）作为度量标准，生成数据集，并测量多个预训练语言模型的BCC，对比模型参数、训练数据量和基准测试分数。

Result: 更大、更强大的预训练语言模型在贝叶斯定理下的信念更新更一致，验证了假设。

Conclusion: 研究结果对理解和管理大型语言模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

### [9] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NeuralDB的编辑框架，通过非线性的门控检索模块高效编辑大型语言模型中的知识，同时保持模型的通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性Locate-and-Edit方法在编辑大规模事实时可能损害语言模型的通用能力，甚至导致遗忘已编辑内容。

Method: 将线性L&E方法建模为查询键值数据库，提出NeuralDB框架，利用非线性门控检索模块仅在涉及编辑事实时操作。

Result: 在10,000条事实的编辑实验中，NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性方面表现优异，且不影响六项文本理解和生成任务的性能。

Conclusion: NeuralDB在扩展到100,000条事实时仍保持高效，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键输入标记并构建方向性引导向量，优化语言和视觉语言模型的行为，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定干预向量，忽视输入标记的因果影响，且未充分利用模型梯度信息。GrAInS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用对比梯度归因（Integrated Gradients）识别关键标记，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活。

Result: 在TruthfulQA上提升13.22%准确率，在MMHal-Bench上减少幻觉率，SPA-VL上对齐胜率提高8.11%。

Conclusion: GrAInS提供细粒度、可解释的行为控制，显著优于微调和现有基线方法。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，减少人工标注需求，并验证其在多语言中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音领域数据标注的高成本和一致性难题，探索LLM在生成合成数据中的潜力。

Method: 通过LLM生成合成短语断句标注，与传统标注方法进行比较，并评估多语言效果。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据有效缓解了短语断句预测的数据挑战。

Conclusion: LLM为语音领域提供了一种可行的数据解决方案。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽成本低且可扩展，但其多样性和隐私风险未被充分研究。

Method: 提出了一套评估多样性和隐私的指标，并通过实验验证了LLM生成数据的局限性，随后提出基于提示的方法改进。

Result: 实验显示LLM生成的合成数据在多样性和隐私保护方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 通过提示方法可提升合成数据的多样性，同时保护隐私。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TELEVAL是一个动态基准测试，专注于评估中文口语模型在真实对话场景中的表现，强调用户自然交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注SLMs能否完成复杂任务，而忽略了用户在实际对话中的自然交互需求。

Method: TELEVAL定义了三个评估维度（显式语义、副语言与隐式语义、系统能力），采用对话形式，并分别评估文本和音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，现有SLMs在自然对话任务中仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL旨在作为用户中心的评估框架，推动对话导向SLMs的发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

*Haomin Qi,Zihan Dai,Chengbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态结合BOFT正交稳定性和LoRA-GA梯度对齐快速收敛的混合参数高效微调方法，显著提升了收敛效率和泛化能力，同时降低了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的微调因计算和内存需求高而成为瓶颈，需要更高效的参数高效微调（PEFT）技术。

Method: 提出了一种混合策略，动态结合BOFT和LoRA-GA的优势，并通过梯度范数指导的逐层自适应更新优化收敛。同时，首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLMs，增强梯度稳定性。

Result: 在多个基准测试（GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench、HumanEval）上，混合方法在7B到405B参数的模型中表现优于单独PEFT基线，接近全微调精度，同时减少训练时间2.1倍和内存使用50%。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限环境下LLMs的实际部署提供了高效且可扩展的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

*Riley Carlson,John Bauer,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 2024年新版GloVe模型通过更新数据和预处理方法，提升了嵌入性能，特别是在NER任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014年的GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但语言和世界在变化，需更新模型以适应当前需求，同时弥补原模型数据版本和预处理方法缺乏详细记录的不足。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练了两组词嵌入模型，并通过词汇比较、直接测试和NER任务进行评估。

Result: 2024年模型包含了新的文化和语言相关词汇，在类比和相似性任务中表现相当，在非西方新闻数据等时间依赖性强的NER任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 新版GloVe模型在保持原有性能的同时，适应了语言变化，提升了特定任务的表现。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一种新型的端到端口语语言模型，专注于语言内容之外的副语言和说话者特征，通过双模态头架构和分阶段训练策略实现高效多任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语语言模型多忽略副语言和说话者特征（如方言、年龄、情感等），限制了自然交互能力。

Method: 采用双模态头架构分离语言建模与声学实现，分阶段训练策略逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL基准测试中，GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应和社会感知的口语系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的能力，重点关注代码生成和编辑任务，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍远落后于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE），涵盖五种常见数学图形。

Result: 实验评估九种主流MLLMs，结果显示现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上表现显著落后于人类。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLMs在代码驱动多模态数学推理评估中的空白，揭示了模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在HIV管理中的能力，开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但模型性能随问题复杂性下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理的复杂性使其成为LLMs应用的理想场景，但临床实践中LLMs的准确性、潜在危害和接受度尚不明确。

Method: 研究开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，评估了七种通用和三种医学专用LLMs，结合词相似度和LLM-as-a-judge方法评估性能。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但性能随问题复杂性下降；医学微调模型未必优于通用模型，推理和理解能力较弱。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估以确保LLMs在临床中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer文本嵌入模型中的'粘性标记'会破坏嵌入可靠性，提出检测方法STD并分析其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粘性标记会干扰句子相似性分布，降低下游任务性能，需系统性研究其成因和影响。

Method: 提出STD检测方法，分析40个模型中的粘性标记，并评估其对下游任务的影响。

Result: 发现868个粘性标记，其存在与模型或词汇量无关，但对任务性能影响显著（下降50%）。

Conclusion: 需改进标记化策略和模型设计以减少粘性标记的影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过消除选项位置偏见和语义邻近干扰，提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多选题任务中可能通过利用选项位置或标签的偏见而非真正理解来获得高分，这影响了评估的准确性。

Method: SCOPE通过无语义内容的空提示估计模型的偏见分布，并逆分布重新分配答案位置，同时避免语义相似干扰项相邻。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SCOPE表现优于现有去偏方法，提升了稳定性和置信度分布。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Conclusion: ISO30401 KMS可以通过SECI模型和PDCA循环有效整合到现有业务流程中，提升知识管理的效率和效果。

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GMTP的新防御方法，通过梯度分析和掩码语言模型检测并过滤对抗性文档，有效保护RAG系统免受恶意注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统依赖外部知识库，但存在恶意文档注入的风险，可能导致生成有害或误导性内容。

Method: GMTP通过分析检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，利用掩码语言模型检查这些令牌的概率，从而检测恶意文档。

Result: 实验表明，GMTP能过滤90%以上的恶意内容，同时保留相关文档，确保检索和生成性能。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种高效的防御方法，能在对抗性环境中保护RAG系统的安全性和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令微调提升大语言模型（LLMs）遵循用户指令的能力，但可能增加对用户输入的依赖，导致错误信息接受和幻觉生成。研究发现指令微调的LLMs更易接受用户提供的错误信息，需系统性方法提升可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令微调对LLMs接受错误信息的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 比较指令微调模型与基础模型对错误信息的接受程度，分析用户角色、提示结构等因素。

Result: 指令微调显著增加LLMs对用户提供错误信息的接受度，依赖从助理角色转向用户角色。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法减少指令微调的副作用，提升LLMs在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 层剪枝会导致隐藏状态幅度差距，引发性能下降，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp，通过离线重缩放剩余权重补偿幅度差距，无运行时开销。

Result: 剪枝5层LLaMA-3-8B时，困惑度减半，保留93.19%问答性能，优于基线4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp有效提升层剪枝性能，是一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Conclusion: Locate-and-Focus方法在术语翻译中表现出色，为语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Method: 比较六种OCR引擎（商业和开源）在Sinhala和Tamil上的性能，使用五种测量技术评估字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上表现最佳（WER 2.61%），Document AI在Tamil上表现最优（CER 0.78%）。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的OCR性能提供了基准，并提出了新的Tamil OCR评测数据集。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通信中需要LLMs适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库难以实现。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器在基础模型上训练多样非结构化风格语料库，再与指令跟随模型合并。

Result: 实验显示风格一致性提升且指令跟随性保持，人类评估确认品牌规范吸收。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs风格个性化提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了机器翻译中性别标记不明确时的翻译问题，发现模型在性别明确时表现良好，但在模糊情况下未能保持不确定性，且去偏方法对明确和模糊情况的影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译模型在性别标记不明确时的表现，尤其是模型是否能在性别模糊时保持不确定性，以及去偏方法的效果。

Method: 使用语义不确定性度量方法，分析模型在性别明确和模糊情况下的翻译表现。

Result: 模型在性别明确时翻译准确，但在模糊情况下未能保持足够的不确定性；去偏方法对明确和模糊情况的影响独立。

Conclusion: 机器翻译模型需改进以在性别模糊时保持不确定性，去偏方法需针对性优化。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，用于改进上下文学习（ICL）中的示例检索能力，解决了跨任务数据分布区分和细粒度反馈连接的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的性能高度依赖示例质量，但现有方法在跨任务数据分布区分和细粒度反馈连接方面存在不足。

Method: TDR框架将不同任务的ICL示例解耦，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈指导检索模块的训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR显著提升了性能，并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松与多种LLM结合，提升ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

*Ariana Sahitaj,Premtim Sahitaj,Veronika Solopova,Jiaao Li,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合人类专家与大语言模型（LLM）的新框架，用于提升社交媒体上宣传内容检测的标注一致性和可扩展性。通过分层分类法和LLM辅助预标注，显著提高了标注效率与一致性，并训练小型语言模型（SLM）进行结构化标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的宣传检测任务复杂且高质量标注数据有限，亟需一种既能保证标注一致性又能扩展的方法。

Method: 提出分层分类法组织14种细粒度宣传技术；通过人类标注研究揭示标注一致性低的问题；设计LLM辅助预标注流程；训练SLM基于LLM生成的高质量数据进行知识蒸馏。

Result: LLM辅助预标注显著提升了标注一致性和时间效率；SLM在LLM生成数据上训练后能有效完成结构化标注。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了新思路，支持透明和负责任的媒体生态系统，符合SDG 16目标。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: CLEAR是一个交互式开源工具，用于分析LLM的错误，提供详细反馈和可视化功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估仅提供单一分数或排名，缺乏具体原因分析，CLEAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CLEAR生成实例级文本反馈，识别系统级错误问题，并通过交互式仪表板进行可视化分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和数学基准测试中展示了其分析能力，并通过用户案例验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR为LLM评估提供了更深入、可操作的分析工具，有助于理解模型性能的具体原因。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科多语言版本内容独立更新导致事实不一致，影响其作为知识源和AI训练数据的可靠性。

Method: 开发了收集、对齐和分析多语言维基百科表格数据的方法，定义了不一致类别，并应用定量和定性指标评估对齐情况。

Result: 通过样本数据集揭示了跨语言表格数据的不一致问题，为事实核查和多语言知识交互提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果对提升维基百科内容的可靠性、多语言知识交互及依赖维基百科的AI系统设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

TL;DR: FinDPO是一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的金融领域专用LLM框架，显著提升了情感分析性能，并在实际投资策略中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融文本数据的情感分析对交易决策和市场动态影响日益显著，但现有监督微调（SFT）方法存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出FinDPO框架，通过DPO进行后训练人类偏好对齐，并引入'logit-to-score'转换生成连续情感分数。

Result: FinDPO在情感分类基准上平均提升11%，年化收益达67%，夏普比率为2.0。

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个在真实交易成本下仍能保持高收益和风险调整性能的情感分析方法。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

TL;DR: AraTable是一个针对阿拉伯语表格数据的新基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的推理和理解能力，填补了阿拉伯语资源的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在处理阿拉伯语表格数据时表现有限，缺乏相关基准资源，因此需要开发AraTable以推动该领域发展。

Method: 采用混合方法，先由LLMs生成内容，再经人工专家过滤和验证，确保数据集质量。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证任务中仍有显著挑战。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据处理提供了宝贵资源，未来需进一步改进复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Result: 最佳模型在新闻测试集上准确率达97.1%，在参考集和ASR集上分别为91.2%和90.2%，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为孟加拉语标点恢复建立了强基线，并公开了数据集和代码，支持低资源NLP的未来研究。

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Result: 合成医学文本在增强数据、辅助任务中表现良好，但隐私问题仍需解决。

Conclusion: 合成医学文本有望加速NLP工作流发展，但需进一步解决隐私和评估问题。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在表格数据生成中存在稀疏特征依赖问题，导致注意力分散，无法有效捕捉关键关系。

Method: GraDe通过动态图学习模块，结合外部提取的功能依赖，优先处理关键特征交互。

Result: 实验显示，GraDe在复杂数据集上性能提升12%，并在合成数据质量上与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: GraDe为LLMs提供了一种结构感知的表格数据建模实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve

Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合标记化策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer标记化在捕捉DNA序列局部结构时存在不足，如标记分布不均和全局上下文理解有限。

Method: 通过结合6-mer标记和600次BPE循环生成的BPE标记，形成平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中表现优异，准确率分别为10.78%、10.1%和4.12%。

Conclusion: 混合标记化策略能同时捕捉DNA序列的局部和全局信息，为基因组语言建模和下游应用奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLM在并行生成时存在质量与速度的严重权衡问题，标准解码的不可逆性导致早期错误积累。

Method: 提出WINO算法，采用并行草稿和验证机制，通过双向上下文验证和重新掩码可疑标记。

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准上加速6倍且准确率提升2.58%，在Flickr30K字幕任务上加速10倍且性能更高。

Conclusion: WINO有效解决了DLLM的质量与速度权衡问题，展示了其优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),
Self-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SRAG), and Multi-Round Accumulative Voting
(MAV). Our method reformulates the quadruplet extraction task into triplet
extraction, uses dynamic retrieval from the training set to create contextual
prompts, and applies multi-round inference with voting to improve output
stability and performance. Our system, based on the Qwen2.5-7B model, achieves
a Hard Score of 26.66, a Soft Score of 48.35, and an Average Score of 37.505 on
the STATE ToxiCN dataset, significantly outperforming baselines such as GPT-4o
(Average Score 15.63) and fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B (Average Score 35.365). The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，现有方法成本高或泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，结合逻辑和自检机制，从未标注数据生成高质量指令调优数据。

Result: 构建了703k数据样本，性能媲美DeepSeek-V3，成本降低83%，数据与下游任务相关性更高。

Conclusion: AQuilt为专业领域提供高效、低成本的数据合成解决方案，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈直接融入提示模型的训练，统一了基于文本反馈和数值奖励的提示优化方法，无需预收集数据集，并在数学数据集GSMHard和MATH上实现了最先进的查询特定提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法分为基于文本反馈和数值奖励的两类，但缺乏统一框架。TRPrompt旨在结合两者优势，直接利用文本反馈训练提示模型，提升大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: TRPrompt框架通过迭代改进生成的提示，结合文本反馈训练提示模型，无需预收集数据集，并利用LLM对“好”提示的理解能力。

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH等数学数据集上，TRPrompt生成的查询特定提示达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRPrompt通过统一文本反馈和数值奖励的方法，提供了一种高效的提示优化框架，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），通过动态评估指令完成情况来提升语言模型的指令遵循能力，相比传统方法在多任务基准上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法使用固定标准（如‘有用性’和‘无害性’）来调整语言模型，限制了其对多样化指令的适应能力。本文旨在通过动态、指令特定的标准来提升模型的指令遵循能力。

Method: 提出RLCF方法，从指令中提取清单，结合AI评估和专用验证程序对响应进行评分，生成强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RLCF均表现最佳，如在FollowBench上提升4点满意度，InFoBench上提升6点，Arena-Hard上胜率提高3点。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是提升语言模型对多样化指令支持能力的关键工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

### [50] [Enhancing Quantization-Aware Training on Edge Devices via Relative Entropy Coreset Selection and Cascaded Layer Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17768)
*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC提出了一种基于核心集的量化感知训练框架，通过相对熵评分和层间校正策略，显著提升了低比特量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动和边缘计算的发展，边缘设备对低比特量化模型的需求增加，但隐私问题限制了数据的使用，传统量化训练方法计算成本高且在小规模数据集上性能下降。

Method: QuaRC采用两阶段方法：核心集选择阶段使用相对熵评分筛选代表性数据子集；训练阶段通过层间校正策略减少量化误差。

Result: 实验显示，QuaRC在1%数据子集上量化ResNet-18到2比特时，ImageNet-1K的Top-1准确率比现有技术提升5.72%。

Conclusion: QuaRC有效解决了小规模数据集下的量化误差问题，显著提升了边缘设备上量化模型的性能。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种低复杂度、通用的AI模型，通过因果不变学习改进语义通信中信道解码器的数据重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义通信中数据重建的挑战，特别是在用户数据多样化和知识随时间演变的情况下。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络（GAN）结合因果不变学习，提取数据的因果和非因果表示，并设计稀疏更新协议以减少通信开销。

Result: 因果不变知识确保了跨设备的一致性，在分类任务中表现优异，数据重建的PSNR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义通信中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化的数据环境。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Conclusion: 调整特征网络的自相似度可显著提升深度神经网络的分类性能，尤其在MLP和注意力架构中效果显著。

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少计算量，同时提供对优化结果的解释性。

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Motivation: LLMs在排序和评估任务中存在位置偏差和重复不一致性，现有方法通过多次重复和多数投票解决，但计算成本高。

Method: 提出动态早期停止方法，自适应确定每实例所需的重复次数，并引入基于置信度的改进。

Result: 动态策略平均减少81%的LLM调用，基于置信度的改进进一步减少到87%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 动态早期停止方法有效减少计算成本，适用于不同规模和任务的LLMs。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Result: 在线性高斯模型和制造过程场景中，CICME表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CICME结合了池化数据和个体领域数据的优势，在某些场景下优于传统方法。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优异，预测性能提升至少2.83%（决定系数），均方根误差降低至少8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM在移动流量预测中表现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性，为网络效率和服务质量提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Conclusion: CoCAI是一种高效且理论扎实的方法，适用于多变量时间序列的预测和异常检测。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Result: 在数学推理任务中，GenSelect表现优于现有评分方法。

Conclusion: GenSelect有效结合了LLM的比较优势和高扩展性。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）进行降水降尺度，生成视觉上真实的降水场，并通过学习到的判别器评估数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率降水预测对减少局地强降雨灾害至关重要，但传统数值天气预报模型在此方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用WGAN进行降水降尺度，利用最优传输成本生成降水场，并与传统均方误差训练的神经网络对比。

Result: WGAN生成的降水场在视觉上更真实，尽管在传统评估指标上表现略低；判别器评分与人类感知真实性相关。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提升降水降尺度的感知真实性，还为降水数据集的质量评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

TL;DR: GraphEXT是一个基于合作博弈论和社会外部性的新型GNN可解释性框架，通过分解子图和量化节点重要性来提升模型解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的'黑盒'特性及其难以捕捉节点间复杂交互模式的挑战。

Method: 利用合作博弈论和社会外部性概念，将节点划分为联盟，分解子图，并通过Shapley值量化节点重要性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构中的保真度优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphEXT显著提升了GNN模型的可解释性，尤其在节点交互和结构变化的影响方面表现突出。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Conclusion: 分子任务算术因其简单、高效和性能，有望成为分子设计中的主流迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Motivation: 为了解决传统神经网络在处理非周期性输入时的局限性，并提升对随机系统动态的学习能力。

Method: 扩展标准FNO，引入镜像填充技术，结合Wong--Zakai定理和近似技术进行理论分析。

Result: MFNO在分辨率泛化能力上优于LSTM、TCN和DeepONet，且生成样本路径的速度显著快于传统数值方法。

Conclusion: MFNO是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于随机系统的动态建模，具有理论和实践上的优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Method: 扩展了公开-私有学习的下界分析，应用于高斯均值估计和线性回归，研究不同分布偏移的影响。

Result: 偏移较小时，需充足数据估计私有参数；偏移较大时，公开数据无帮助。

Conclusion: 分布偏移大小决定了公开数据在差分隐私学习中的有效性。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Result: FL为云机器人操作提供了高效、可靠的解决方案，但也面临挑战。

Conclusion: FL在云机器人操作中具有潜力，需进一步研究以解决其挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Method: 采用变分自编码器（VAE）结合回归器（pVAE），利用卷积神经网络（CNN）预测水力特性，并通过LBM生成数据。训练数据集包括合成多孔微结构和真实开孔泡沫的CT扫描图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成具有目标特性的新型超材料提供了高效途径，相关数据和代码将开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Motivation: 解释SOTA神经网络的性能，并提供对HTSR理论中关键指标的形式化解释。

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学方法，推导SETOL理论，并通过3层MLP和SOTA神经网络验证。

Result: SETOL理论假设与实验数据高度一致，HTSR和SETOL指标在MLP和SOTA神经网络中表现一致。

Conclusion: SETOL为理解神经网络性能提供了新视角，并提出了新的学习预条件和指标ERG。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Motivation: 现有对抗性提示生成方法存在规模小或缺乏真实性的问题，需要结合人类创造力和机器计算能力。

Method: 提出Seed2Harvest方法，通过扩展人类手工对抗性提示种子，生成多样且真实的对抗性提示。

Result: 生成的数据集具有更高的多样性（535个地理位置，香农熵7.48）和可比的攻击成功率（0.31-0.36）。

Conclusion: 人机协作在全面、可扩展的红队测试中至关重要，有助于持续评估T2I模型的安全性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在静态空间假设、跨城市泛化能力差、计算成本高且无法捕捉空间结构等问题，限制了城市范围分析的实用性。

Method: 结合时间图卷积编码器和基于Transformer的解码器，采用三阶段迁移学习策略（预训练、冷启动适应、强化学习微调）。

Result: 在加州三个大都市区的1.03亿条GPS记录上验证，UrbanPulse实现了最先进的准确性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UrbanPulse通过高效迁移学习，为高分辨率AI城市预测的实际部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Conclusion: MFTRR通过模拟人类认知过程，有效解决了帖子质量评估中的关键问题，展示了多模态和细粒度推理的重要性。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

TL;DR: SIFOTL是一种隐私保护的数据分析方法，通过统计摘要和XGBoost模型识别表格数据中的变化因素，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗等领域中因隐私限制和复杂噪声导致的数据分析困难。

Method: 提取隐私合规的统计摘要，使用双XGBoost模型和LLM分离信号与噪声，并通过Pareto加权决策树合并结果。

Result: 在MEPS数据集上F1得分为0.85，优于基线方法；在18个EHR数据集上表现稳健，F1为0.75-0.96。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种可解释、隐私保护且抗噪声的数据分析工作流。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Result: 通过模型“遗忘”能力，增强了数据驱动TSEP的可信度和可靠性。

Conclusion: TSEP-Machine Unlearning为解决隐私和数据安全问题提供了有效途径，提升了智能交通系统的信任度。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Motivation: 高分辨率海洋数据对沿海管理、环境监测和海上安全至关重要，但现有卫星数据和全球海洋模型缺乏足够的空间分辨率。

Method: 采用监督深度学习框架，基于神经算子解决偏微分方程，并能生成任意分辨率的解。此外，提出了降尺度模型应用于Copernicus海洋数据。

Result: 在真实Copernicus海洋数据和合成Navier-Stokes模拟数据集上验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为偏微分方程建模并提供高分辨率解，解决了现有数据分辨率不足的问题。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

TL;DR: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器和自适应差分脉冲编码调制，有效保护穿戴设备数据隐私，同时保持活动识别性能，并减少数据传输量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 穿戴设备的加速度计和陀螺仪数据可能泄露用户身份，隐私保护在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM），先通过AAE提取活动特征并抑制身份信息，再用ADPCM进一步隐藏身份并压缩数据。

Result: 实验显示，C-AAE将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15%，活动识别F1分数仅下降5%，数据量减少75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在医疗传感器数据中实现了隐私保护和实用性的平衡。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM 是一种分阶段混合精度后训练量化框架，通过将80%的权重量化为1位、20%为4位，平均每权重1.6位，显著减少LLM的存储和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署因参数庞大和计算成本高而具有挑战性，极端压缩（如平均位宽≤2）常导致性能严重下降。

Method: 提出Squeeze10-LLM，结合Post-Binarization Activation Robustness（PBAR）和Full Information Activation Supervision（FIAS）两种创新方法，优化低比特量化下的精度。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2上，Squeeze10-LLM在6个零样本分类任务中平均准确率从43%提升至56%，优于现有PTQ方法。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM在超低比特量化中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了模型效率与精度。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论框架，通过将硬标签和额外监督信息结合为概率分布，构建软标签，以提高数据稀缺情况下的分类模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺或标注成本高的场景下，如何利用额外的监督信息（如置信度）提升分类模型的性能。

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督信息视为概率分布，通过仿射组合构建软标签，并理论分析其对泛化性能的影响。

Result: 额外监督的核心价值在于非硬标签类的分布信息，而非硬标签的置信度；软标签的优化方向由额外监督决定，混合系数控制步长。

Conclusion: 通过理论和实验验证，合理设计额外监督信息可显著提升分类精度。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Result: PDA-DRL比基线方法平均延迟降低38%，个性化方法优于传统聚合方法。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL和个性化权重共享方法在开放RAN中有效优化资源分配和延迟性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 该方法通过不修改环境的方式实现了高效的对抗攻击，为RL系统的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在数学推理任务中如何通过自身置信度实现性能提升，减少对外部验证的依赖。

Method: 使用模型前缀置信度（32个标记）选择最有希望的尝试，并在五个数学推理数据集（GSM8K、MATH500、AMC23、AIME24、AIME25）上评估。

Result: 前缀置信度缩放比多数投票更高效，且不易受长度偏差影响；测试时训练虽优于基础模型，但未超越前缀置信度缩放。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度缩放是一种有效的自我改进方法，适用于数学推理任务，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Result: 实验表明，GraphALP在带有噪声标签的类别不平衡图上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GraphALP通过结合LLM和伪标签技术，有效解决了类别不平衡和标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Result: 理论证明框架在噪声条件下的收敛性和稳定性，实验验证其在合成和真实数据集上的先进性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过动态时间分析显著提升了噪声标签下的学习效果，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 通过跨数据集评估（Argoverse2训练，NuScenes测试）验证了目标选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在未见场景中的泛化性能。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL通过半异步框架和ClusterCast机制，有效解决了FGL中的效率和语义一致性问题，为分布式图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM通过优化库设计，显著降低了用户负担并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习PPM方法因现实事件日志的低变异性和小规模而受限的问题。

Result: 在真实事件日志上表现优于现有方法，统计增强显著优于随机转换。

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM为过程预测中的数据增强提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分物理的无结构网格粗化算法，通过k-means聚类、自动微分和随机最小化算法，显著减少网格点数，同时保持关键点动态精度。

Result: 在两种PDE（线性抛物方程和波动方程）测试中，网格点数减少10倍，关键点动态精度保持。

Conclusion: 该算法适用于任意由演化偏微分方程描述的系统模拟。

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决持续学习中安全回归问题的方法，通过引入回归感知惩罚来减少有害预测变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件快速演变，传统机器学习检测器需要持续更新，但完全重新训练不现实。持续学习虽能增量更新，但可能引发安全回归问题，即先前检测到的恶意软件在更新后逃逸检测。

Method: 论文形式化并量化了安全回归问题，提出了一种回归感知惩罚方法，并调整了Positive Congruent Training（PCT）以适应持续学习环境。

Result: 在ELSA、Tesseract和AZ-Class数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了安全回归，同时保持了检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在持续学习环境中有效解决了安全回归问题，提升了恶意软件检测器的可靠性。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TIDSIT的新架构，用于解决电池健康状态（SoH）估计中不规则时间序列数据的挑战，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池在能源存储和车辆中的广泛应用使其健康监测变得至关重要，但现有机器学习模型难以处理不规则测量数据。

Method: 提出TIDSIT架构，结合连续时间嵌入和时序注意力机制，处理非均匀采样和变长序列。

Result: 在NASA电池退化数据集上，TIDSIT将预测误差降低50%以上，SoH预测误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT不仅提高了电池SoH估计的准确性，还具有通用性，适用于其他不规则时间序列的健康监测任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

*Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,Leonard Hinckeldey,Riccardo Zamboni,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 当前多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法依赖简单约定而非有效马尔可夫信号恢复，导致策略脆弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前MARL方法是否真正解决了Dec-POMDP的核心挑战，还是仅依赖简单约定。

Method: 通过案例研究分析MARL算法的行为，揭示其依赖约定而非环境观察和记忆。

Result: 发现智能体学习到的策略脆弱，无法与非适应性智能体协作，但任务设计可促使其学习更稳健策略。

Conclusion: 呼吁设计新环境，要求智能体基于观察和记忆推理，而非依赖脆弱约定。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HyperDeepONets因高参数数量导致的高内存和计算成本问题。

Method: 利用LoRA将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，减少参数并引入额外正则化。

Result: 在常微分方程和偏微分方程实验中，参数减少70%，预测精度和泛化能力优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets在物理信息机器学习中是一种高效且性能优越的替代架构。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLMs在不确定性量化方面存在挑战，传统方法计算成本高。

Method: 通过蒸馏技术将多前向传播的教师模型压缩为学生模型，采用LoRA微调，比较了两种蒸馏策略：传统softmax和Dirichlet分布输出。

Result: 学生模型在单次前向传播中实现了与教师模型相当或更优的性能和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 首次证明通过证据蒸馏可在LLMs中实现即时且稳健的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据稀缺地区洪水预测和水资源管理的挑战，同时兼顾准确性、可解释性和计算效率。

Method: 使用贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）结合43个未校准的水文模型，再通过水库计算（RC）进行误差修正，适用于无测站流域。

Result: 在数据丰富和稀缺条件下，HYPER性能优于LSTM，计算时间仅为5%，且不确定性更低。

Conclusion: HYPER为无测站流域提供了一种高效、鲁棒且可推广的洪水预测解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双模拟度量存在两个主要问题：无法表示某些独特场景，以及依赖预定义权重。这些问题源于奖励差距定义不精确和忽视不同训练阶段的重要性差异。

Method: 通过引入状态-动作对的度量，提出了一种改进的双模拟度量，包括更精确的奖励差距定义和带有自适应系数的新更新算子。

Conclusion: 改进的双模拟度量在理论和实验上均表现出优越性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Result: 在Cornell等基准数据集上表现优异，提供轻量且可解释的异质图解决方案。

Conclusion: GLANCE为异质图学习提供了高效、适应性强的框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Method: 使用Price方程对变化进行简单的符号划分，推导出力-度量-偏置（FMB）定律，统一了多种算法和自然选择过程。

Conclusion: FMB定律为理解、比较和设计跨学科的学习算法提供了理论基础，揭示了其共同的数学本质。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Conclusion: 研究为GPTQ奠定了坚实的理论基础，并为未来量化算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

TL;DR: 提出了一种线性内存消耗的SE(2)不变注意力机制，用于自动驾驶中的空间数据处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算所有对象对的相对位姿，内存消耗为二次方，限制了其扩展性。

Method: 设计了SE(2)不变的点积注意力机制，内存消耗与对象数量成线性关系。

Result: 实验证明该方法易于实现且性能优于非不变架构。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的空间数据处理方案。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质序列生成在生物学中应用广泛，但现有条件扩散模型在可靠生成蛋白质方面仍存在问题。

Method: 提出多级条件扩散模型，整合序列和结构信息，同时生成多级表示，并设计Protein-MMD评估指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架和评估指标在条件蛋白质生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型和评估指标为蛋白质设计提供了高效可靠的方法。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决物理约束环境下人机协作的复杂性，如连续状态-动作空间和受限动态。

Method: 提出了BASS方法（行为增强、模拟和选择），通过增强行为多样性和动作结果理解来应对挑战。

Result: 实验表明，BASS在AI-AI和人机协作任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Moving Out基准测试和BASS方法为物理约束环境下的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 系统展示了Tiny ML在低功耗设备上的高效应用潜力。

Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny
Machine Learning (Tiny ML) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The
system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.

TL;DR: 研究评估了四种LLM代理通信策略在数学问题解决中的效果，发现双代理优于单代理，其中“同伴协作”表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同通信策略对LLM代理协作问题解决的影响，以优化AI教育应用。

Method: 在OpenAI GPT-4o模型中，测试四种通信模式（师生互动、同伴协作、互教互学、批判性辩论）于双代理数学问题解决环境。

Result: 双代理优于单代理，同伴协作准确率最高；对话行为（陈述、确认、提示）对协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 多代理框架提升计算任务，但有效通信策略是解决AI教育中复杂问题的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Conclusion: AI系统有望减轻行政负担，支持临床医生提供高效、高质量的护理。

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Motivation: 数字时代社交媒体对青少年身体形象的影响日益显著，研究旨在对比抖音和微信的不同影响。

Method: 采用平台化视角，对395名10至24岁男性青少年进行问卷调查，使用MBSRQ-AS评估身体形象。

Result: 抖音使用与外观评价和身体区域满意度显著相关，微信则无显著关联。

Conclusion: 研究强调平台特性对社交媒体影响的重要性，为改善中国男性青少年身体形象问题提供启示。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping
adolescents' body image perceptions. This study examines how Douyin and WeChat,
two contrasting Chinese social media platforms, influence body image among
Chinese male adolescents. Employing a platformization perspective, we surveyed
395 male adolescents aged 10 to 24 using the Multidimensional Body-Self
Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) to assess self-evaluation
and body satisfaction. Our findings reveal that Douyin usage is significantly
correlated with appearance evaluation and body area satisfaction, while WeChat
usage shows no significant correlation with any body image dimensions. These
results suggest that Douyin's algorithm-driven, video-centric environment
intensifies exposure to idealized body standards, impacting users at a
cognitive level. This study underscores the importance of considering
platform-specific characteristics in understanding social media's impact on
body image. It contributes to the broader discourse on how technological design
and content modalities mediate psychological outcomes, offering insights for
addressing body image concerns among male adolescents in China.

their usual T1D management. Findings: The BrisT1D dataset features both device
data from the T1D management systems and smartwatches used by participants, as
well as transcripts of monthly interviews and focus groups conducted during the
study. The device data is provided in a processed state, for usability and more
rapid analysis, and in a raw state, for in-depth exploration of novel insights
captured in the study. Conclusions: This dataset has a range of potential
applications. The quantitative elements can support blood glucose prediction,
hypoglycaemia prediction, and closed-loop algorithm development. The
qualitative elements enable the exploration of user experiences and opinions,

Conclusion: DHMS表现良好，但需进一步测试集成性、用户接受度和扩展性，以支持全校部署。

Abstract: Traditional hostel management practices in academic institutions often suffer
from inefficiencies, delays, and fragmented communication. These systems fail
to meet the expectations of digitally native students and place a significant
operational burden on hostel staff. This paper introduces DHMS (Digital Hostel
Management System), a modular and integrated platform designed to digitize and
streamline essential hostel management functions. DHMS leverages modern web
technologies, artificial intelligence, and cloud infrastructure to automate
room allotment, grievance redressal, gate pass logistics, and communication via
a natural language chatbot. In simulation tests, DHMS achieved a 92% student
satisfaction rate in room allocation and maintained an average chatbot response
time below one second. Additional features include predictive analytics for
proactive maintenance planning and sentiment analysis for feedback processing.
While promising, the system requires further testing for integration across
multiple hostel blocks, user acceptance, scalability under load, and ERP
compatibility before campus-wide deployment. This work discusses the system
architecture, implementation approach, and factors critical to improving user
experience, administrative efficiency, and decision-making processes.

too detailed and not contextualized for the user trying to understand the AI
system. In this work, we present our vision for an interactive agent that works
together with the user to co-construct an explanation that is simultaneously
useful to the user as well as grounded in data provenance. To illustrate this
vision, we present: 1) an initial prototype of such an agent; and 2) a scalable
evaluation framework based on user simulations and a large language model as a
judge approach.

Abstract: Domain-specific visualizations sometimes focus on narrow, albeit important,
tasks for one group of users. This focus limits the utility of a visualization
to other groups working with the same data. While tasks elicited from other
groups can present a design pitfall if not disambiguated, they also present a
design opportunity -- development of visualizations that support multiple
groups. This development choice presents a trade off of broadening the scope
but limiting support for the more narrow tasks of any one group, which in some
cases can enhance the overall utility of the visualization. We investigate this
scenario through a design study where we develop \textit{Guidepost}, a
notebook-embedded visualization of supercomputer queue data that helps
scientists assess supercomputer queue wait times, machine learning researchers
understand prediction accuracy, and system maintainers analyze usage trends. We
adapt the use of personas for visualization design from existing literature in
the HCI and software engineering domains and apply them in categorizing tasks
based on their uniqueness across the stakeholder personas. Under this model,
tasks shared between all groups should be supported by interactive
visualizations and tasks unique to each group can be deferred to scripting with
notebook-embedded visualization design. We evaluate our visualization with nine
expert analysts organized into two groups: a "research analyst" group that uses
supercomputer queue data in their research (representing the Machine Learning
researchers and Jobs Data Analyst personas) and a "supercomputer user" group
that uses this data conditionally (representing the HPC User persona). We find
that our visualization serves our three stakeholder groups by enabling users to
successfully execute shared tasks with point-and-click interaction while
facilitating case-specific programmatic analysis workflows.

Result: 算法在自然碰撞避免数据中验证，R2作为置信度指标，分类性能良好。

Conclusion: 算法高效、通用，适用于多种场景和道路用户，但存在一定局限性。

Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated
driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not
limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver
response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human
driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and
a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual
annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal
movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data
where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for
the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding
road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques
for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are
not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a
piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that
can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal
time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake
onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence
metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification
performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both
ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.
Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,
generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly
configurable.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Conclusion: 研究强调了视觉显示方式在空间相关性识别中的重要性，为未来可视化设计提供了指导。

Abstract: In this work we study the identification of spatial correlation in
distributions of 2D scalar fields, presented across different forms of visual
displays. We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped
scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can
identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this
setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of
fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare
two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed
views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we
investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level
of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's
results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while
also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments
made in assessing spatial correlation. Supplemental material is available at

Result: 发现幸福游戏体验能带来反思、学习、社交、健康和职业等积极影响。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了幸福游戏体验的理论模型，为研究者和从业者提供了促进玩家积极成果的实践启示。

Abstract: While much of the research in digital games has emphasized hedonic
experiences, such as flow, enjoyment, and positive affect, recent years have
seen increased interest in eudaimonic gaming experiences, typically
mixed-affect and associated with personal meaningfulness and growth. The
formation of such experiences in games is theorized to have four constituent
elements: motivation, game use, experience, and effects. However, while the
first three elements have been relatively well explored in the literature, the
effects - and how they may influence positive individual outcomes - have been
underexplored thus far. To this end, in this work, we investigate the perceived
outcomes of eudaimonic gaming and how different components of the experience
influence these effects. We conducted a survey (n = 166) in which respondents
recounted meaningful gaming experiences and how they affected their present
lives. We used a mixed-methods approach to classify effects and identify
significant subcomponents of their formation. We contribute an empirical
understanding of how meaningful gaming experiences can lead to positive
reflective, learning, social, health, and career effects, extending current
theoretical models of eudaimonic gaming experiences and offering implications
for how researchers and practitioners might use these findings to promote
positive outcomes for players.

### [125] [Effects of variation in system responsiveness on user performance in virtual environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18085)
*Benjamin Watson,Neff Walker,William Ribarsky,Victoria Spaulding*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文研究了虚拟环境中的系统响应性（SR），分析了其统计特性（MSR和SDSR）对抓取和放置任务性能的影响，发现SDSR仅在超过82毫秒时影响性能，且放置任务对SR更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨虚拟环境中系统响应性（SR）的统计特性及其对用户任务性能的影响，以优化人机交互设计。

Method: 通过三个实验（分别有11、12和10名参与者）研究MSR和SDSR对抓取和放置任务的影响，采用被试内设计。

Result: SDSR仅在超过82毫秒时影响性能；放置任务对SR更敏感，需要更频繁的视觉反馈。

Conclusion: 虚拟环境设计无需严格控制SDSR，可根据视觉反馈需求调整SR控制，结果适用于多种交互图形应用。

Abstract: System responsiveness (SR) is defined as the elapsed time until a system
responds to user control. SR fluctuates over time, so it must be described
statistically with mean (MSR) and standard deviation (SDSR). In this paper, we
examine SR in virtual environments (VEs), outlining its components and methods
of experimental measurement and manipulation. Three studies of MSR and SDSR
effects on performance of grasp and placement tasks are then presented. The
studies used within-subjects designs with 11, 12, and 10 participants,
respectively. Results showed that SDSR affected performance only if it was
above 82 ms. Placement required more frequent visual feedback and was more
sensitive to SR. We infer that VE designers need not tightly control SDSR and
may wish to vary SR control based on required visual feedback frequency. These
results may be used to improve the human-computer interface in a wide range of
interactive graphical applications, including scientific visualization,
training, mental health, and entertainment.

*Shizhen Zhang,Shengxin Li,Quan Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Understood是一个基于混合现实的系统，旨在帮助成人ADHD患者在现实沟通中减少认知负担和提升流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人ADHD患者因执行功能障碍和情绪失调面临沟通挑战，现有干预措施多针对儿童，缺乏适合成人的工具。

Method: 通过访谈和设计研讨会确定需求，开发了具有实时对话摘要、上下文感知建议和话题转移提醒功能的MR系统。

Result: 用户研究和专家访谈表明，该系统在支持沟通方面高效且易用。

Conclusion: Understood为成人ADHD患者提供了一种有效的沟通辅助工具，可作为治疗干预的补充。

Abstract: Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience
communication challenges, primarily due to executive dysfunction and emotional
dysregulation, even after years of social integration. While existing
interventions predominantly target children through structured or intrusive
methods, adults lack tools that translate clinical strategies into daily
communication support. To address this gap, we present Understood, a Mixed
Reality (MR) system implemented on Microsoft HoloLens 2, designed to assist
adults with ADHD in real-world communication. Through formative semi-structured
interviews and a design workshop, we identified critical communication barriers
and derived design goals for the system. Understood combines three key
features: (1) real-time conversation summarization to reduce cognitive load,
(2) context-aware subsequent word suggestions during moments of disfluency, and
(3) topic shifting detection and reminding to mitigate off-topic transitions. A
within-subjects user study and expert interviews demonstrate that Understood
effectively supports communication with high usability, offering a complement
to therapist-mediated interventions.

*Yuheng Zhao,Xueli Shu,Liwen Fan,Lin Gao,Yu Zhang,Siming Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ProactiveVA的框架，通过LLM驱动的UI代理主动监测用户交互并提供上下文感知的辅助，解决了传统VA系统仅在用户请求时提供帮助的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VA系统仅在用户明确请求时提供帮助，无法在用户最需要时主动提供建议，因此需要更智能的辅助机制。

Method: 通过分析用户交互日志中的求助行为，设计了一个三阶段的UI代理流程（感知、推理、行动），并开发了ProactiveVA框架。

Result: 在两种代表性VA系统中实现了该框架，并通过算法评估、案例研究、专家研究和用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ProactiveVA框架能够有效提供主动辅助，但仍存在设计权衡和进一步探索的空间。

Abstract: Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied to complex data, thus requiring
complex tools. While visual analytics empowers analysts in data analysis,
analysts may get lost in the complexity occasionally. This highlights the need
for intelligent assistance mechanisms. However, even the latest LLM-assisted VA
systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them
insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the
most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors
user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design
effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing
help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need
proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should
intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in
terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and
controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI
agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent
autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing
tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of
the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA
systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness
through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We
also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further
exploration.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了音乐推荐系统对听众的影响，揭示了听众对推荐系统的认知不足及性别差异问题，呼吁跨学科研究和提高算法意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨音乐推荐系统可能导致的代表性伤害，尤其是从心理社会和文化角度分析听众的体验。

Method: 通过访谈意大利音乐听众，并运用情感文本分析法分析其叙述。

Result: 研究发现听众对推荐系统缺乏批判性理解，且未充分意识到性别差异等代表性伤害。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要跨学科研究和提高算法意识，以构建可信赖的推荐系统。

Abstract: Recommender systems shape music listening worldwide due to their widespread
adoption in online platforms. Growing concerns about representational harms
that these systems may cause are nowadays part of the scientific and public
debate, wherein music listener perspectives are oftentimes reported and
discussed from a cognitive-behaviorism perspective, but rarely contextualised
under a psychosocial and cultural lens. We proceed in this direction, by
interviewing a group of Italian music listeners and analysing their narratives
through Emotional Textual Analysis. Thanks to this, we identify shared cultural
repertoires that reveal people's complex relationship with listening practices:
even when familiar with online platforms, listeners may still lack a critical
understanding of recommender systems. Moreover, representational issues,
particularly gender disparities, seem not yet fully grasped in the context of
online music listening. This study underscores the need for interdisciplinary
research to address representational harms, and the role of algorithmic
awareness and digital literacy in developing trustworthy recommender systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态人机协作框架，用于从眼动追踪信号中提取认知模式，结合专家评分和异常检测模块，显著提升了分析的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动追踪数据虽能揭示用户认知状态，但其结构化、非语言特性使其难以分析。现有大语言模型（LLMs）擅长文本推理，但对时间和数值数据处理能力有限。

Method: 框架包括多阶段管道（水平和垂直分割+LLM推理）、专家-模型协同评分模块（结合专家判断和LLM输出）以及混合异常检测模块（LSTM时间建模+LLM语义分析）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个LLM和提示策略下提升了分析的一致性、可解释性和性能，难度预测任务准确率最高达50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为认知建模提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案，在自适应学习、人机交互和教育分析中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了不流畅语音在人机对话中对用户感知的影响，发现不流畅的语音代理被认为更胜任，但未显著影响对话灵活性或拟人化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不流畅语音在人机对话中的作用，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 61名参与者在Namer-Matcher任务中与流畅或不流畅语音代理互动，前后完成伙伴建模问卷。

Result: 不流畅代理被认为更胜任，但未显著影响对话灵活性或拟人化；不流畅代理增加了自我中心沟通。

Conclusion: 不流畅语音可能影响用户对代理的胜任感，但对其他方面影响有限，需进一步研究其机制。

Abstract: Speech disfluencies play a role in perspective-taking and audience design in
human-human communication (HHC), but little is known about their impact in
human-machine dialogue (HMD). In an online Namer-Matcher task, sixty-one
participants interacted with a speech agent using either fluent or disfluent
speech. Participants completed a partner-modelling questionnaire (PMQ) both
before and after the task. Post-interaction evaluations indicated that
participants perceived the disfluent agent as more competent, despite no
significant differences in pre-task ratings. However, no notable differences
were observed in assessments of conversational flexibility or human-likeness.
Our findings also reveal evidence of egocentric and allocentric language
production when participants interact with speech agents. Interaction with
disfluent speech agents appears to increase egocentric communication in
comparison to fluent agents. Although the wide credibility intervals mean this
effect is not clear-cut. We discuss potential interpretations of this finding,
focusing on how disfluencies may impact partner models and language production
in HMD.

TL;DR: PALM是一个学习分析仪表盘，通过整合课程级信息解决学习分析的可扩展性问题，提升学生对学习行为的认知和自我调节学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习分析主要关注单门课程或学生，缺乏对课程间关系及长期学习轨迹的考虑。PALM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发PALM，将多层教育数据整合到课程地图中，并通过系统评估其对学生学习行为意识和现有系统性能的影响。

Result: PALM显著提升了学生对学习规划和反思的认知，视觉呈现和可用性优于现有系统。

Conclusion: PALM为学习分析提供了更全面、可扩展的解决方案，增强了学生的自我调节学习和参与度。

Abstract: This study proposes and evaluates the PAnoramic Learning Map (PALM), a
learning analytics (LA) dashboard designed to address the scalability
challenges of LA by integrating curriculum-level information. Traditional LA
research has predominantly focused on individual courses or learners and often
lacks a framework that considers the relationships between courses and the
long-term trajectory of learning. To bridge this gap, PALM was developed to
integrate multilayered educational data into a curriculum map, enabling
learners to intuitively understand their learning records and academic
progression. We conducted a system evaluation to assess PALM's effectiveness in
two key areas: (1) its impact on students' awareness of their learning
behaviors, and (2) its comparative performance against existing systems. The
results indicate that PALM enhances learners' awareness of study planning and
reflection, particularly by improving perceived behavioral control through the
visual presentation of individual learning histories and statistical trends,
which clarify the links between learning actions and outcomes. Although PALM
requires ongoing refinement as a system, it received significantly higher
evaluations than existing systems in terms of visual appeal and usability. By
serving as an information resource with previously inaccessible insights, PALM
enhances self-regulated learning and engagement, representing a significant
step beyond conventional LA toward a comprehensive and scalable approach.

Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create
a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies.
Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the
interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and
characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the
integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must
account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive
load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities
multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied
to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

Conclusion: 该框架为决策中心的可视化研究提供了新的方向和设计依据。

Abstract: Decision-making is a central yet under-defined goal in visualization
research. While existing task models address decision processes, they often
neglect the conditions framing a decision. To better support decision-making
tasks, we propose a characterization scheme that describes decision problems
through key properties of the data, users, and task context. This scheme helps
visualization researchers specify decision-support claims more precisely and
informs the design of appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to characterize decision
tasks targeted by existing design studies, highlighting opportunities for
future research in decision-centric visualization.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ForcePinch是一种基于捏合力的空间交互方法，通过动态调整跟踪速度实现高效与精确的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术将跟踪速度调整与手部移动直接耦合，限制了交互灵活性。ForcePinch受物理世界中自然摩擦控制的启发，旨在提供更直观的交互体验。

Method: 开发了集成压力传感器的硬件原型，将捏合力映射为跟踪速度调整，并与Go-Go和PRISM技术进行对比用户研究。

Result: 用户研究表明，ForcePinch在不同交互场景中表现出独特优势。

Conclusion: ForcePinch展示了力响应交互的多样性和潜力，为未来空间交互设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatial interaction in 3D environments requires balancing efficiency and
precision, which requires dynamic tracking speed adjustments. However, existing
techniques often couple tracking speed adjustments directly with hand
movements, reducing interaction flexibility. Inspired by the natural friction
control inherent in the physical world, we introduce ForcePinch, a novel
force-responsive spatial interaction method that enables users to intuitively
modulate pointer tracking speed and smoothly transition between rapid and
precise movements by varying their pinching force. To implement this concept,
we developed a hardware prototype integrating a pressure sensor with a
customizable mapping function that translates pinching force into tracking
speed adjustments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants performing
well-established 1D, 2D, and 3D object manipulation tasks, comparing ForcePinch
against the distance-responsive technique Go-Go and speed-responsive technique
PRISM. Results highlight distinctive characteristics of the force-responsive
approach across different interaction contexts. Drawing on these findings, we
highlight the contextual meaning and versatility of force-responsive
interactions through four illustrative examples, aiming to inform and inspire
future spatial interaction design.

TL;DR: PosterMate是一个海报设计助手，通过生成多样化的用户角色代理来模拟目标受众的反馈，帮助设计师整合多方意见并优化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海报设计需要多样化的受众反馈，但实际收集和协调这些反馈具有挑战性。生成式AI模型为模拟人类互动提供了可能，但其在设计反馈中的应用尚不明确。

Method: PosterMate通过营销文档构建用户角色代理，收集各代理对海报组件的反馈，并通过讨论达成一致意见，最终整合到设计中。

Result: 用户研究（N=12）表明PosterMate能捕捉被忽视的观点，并作为有效的原型工具。在线评估（N=100）显示反馈符合角色身份，讨论能有效综合不同观点。

Conclusion: PosterMate展示了生成式AI在设计反馈中的潜力，能够高效整合多样化意见，提升设计质量。

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Conclusion: DLB工具在支持研究可重复性方面具有潜力，尤其是在沉浸式环境中表现更优。

Abstract: Ensuring reproducibility of research is an integral part of good scientific
practice. One way to support this is through provenance: information about
research workflows from data gathering to researchers' sensemaking processes
leading to published results. This is highly important in disciplines such as
geosciences, where researchers use software for interactive and immersive
visualizations of geospatial data, doing virtual measurements in simulated
fieldwork on 3D models. We evaluated a provenance management tool, which allows
recording of interactions with a virtual fieldwork tool and annotating
different states of the visualization. The user study investigated how
researchers used this Digital Lab Book (DLB) and whether perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness differed between groups in immersive or non-immersive
settings. Participants perceived the DLB as both useful and easy to use. While
there were indications of differences in perceived ease of use (higher for
immersive setting), usage patterns showed no significant group differences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解流动物理与准确预测同样重要，因此研究旨在通过SR揭示复杂流动的数学关系，无需先验模型假设。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值数据中推导符号方程，并结合ASP框架确保方程在物理上的合理性。

Result: 推导的方程不仅近似模拟了抛物线速度分布和压力降，还与文献中的解析解完全一致。

Conclusion: 研究表明SR能简化复杂流动行为为可解释方程，且结合知识表示方法可提升数据驱动模型的可靠性和领域一致性。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统在数据分析中忽视了结构化推理过程，导致推理步骤缺乏一致性。

Method: 提出I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务模拟分析推理的认知步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中表现优于现有系统，规划一致性和洞察对齐性更优。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析代理设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统APS因定制和维护成本高昂而难以普及，供应链规划师需要更易用的解决方案。

Method: 开发了SmartAPS，利用工具增强的LLM，提供自然语言聊天界面，支持查询、反事实推理、推荐和场景分析。

Result: SmartAPS通过直观的界面帮助规划师更好地管理运营。

Conclusion: SmartAPS为运营规划提供了更易用的解决方案，降低了使用门槛。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需通过非确定性有限自动机解决计划存在性问题，但合成策略需昂贵的确定性步骤。本文旨在找到可直接映射到确定性自动机的规划分支。

Method: 识别定性时间线规划的一个分支，其计划存在性问题可映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，并确定适合该分支的Allen关系的最大子集。

Result: 成功识别了一个可直接使用确定性自动机合成策略的规划分支，并确定了适用的最大Allen关系子集。

Conclusion: 该研究为时间线规划提供了一种更高效的策略合成方法，避免了昂贵的确定性步骤。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过五个阶段将模型生成的错误转化为创造性资产，显著提升创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正的创造力，认为“创造力潜藏在失败中”。

Method: 采用五阶段生成管道（错误生成、放大、精炼选择、转换和利用反馈），结合认知科学和生成模型，使用多种技术工具（如LLaMA-2-7B-Chat、SBERT等）和复合奖励函数。

Result: 创造力分数提升70.4%，精炼后的标语更短、更新颖，跨模态测试和人评均表现优异。

Conclusion: 错误中心和反馈驱动的生成方法能有效增强AI创造力，为自进化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索图表是否能为AI系统提供类似人类的视觉辅助优势。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5进行实验，比较散点图、空白图和错误图对模型表现的影响。

Result: 散点图显著提升模型对复杂数据的描述精确度和准确性。

Conclusion: 初步证明AI系统能从可视化中受益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中式训练或缺乏理论保证，MAGPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAGPO采用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并明确对齐分散式策略以确保可部署性。

Result: 在43个任务和6种环境中，MAGPO表现优于CTDE基线，并匹敌或超越完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

TL;DR: ASI-Arch是首个用于AI研究的超级智能系统，通过自主进行神经架构创新，突破了人类认知限制，发现了106种先进架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究受限于人类认知能力，ASI-Arch旨在通过自主创新解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用完全自主的架构发现方法，超越传统NAS，进行端到端研究，包括假设、实现、训练和验证。

Result: 在20,000 GPU小时内完成1,773次实验，发现106种SOTA线性注意力架构，并建立了科学发现的扩展定律。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为自加速AI系统提供了蓝图，将研究进展从人类限制转变为可计算扩展的过程。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化临床数据管道的Agentic AI框架，通过模块化代理处理从数据输入到推理的全流程，减少人工干预，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器学习解决方案构建和部署成本高、流程复杂，需应对数据隐私和兼容性问题。

Method: 采用模块化代理系统，自动处理结构化与非结构化数据，包括特征提取、模型匹配、预处理推荐等。

Result: 在老年病学、姑息治疗和结肠镜检查等数据集上验证了框架的有效性，实现了自动化特征选择和模型推理。

Conclusion: 该框架显著降低了机器学习生命周期中的专家干预需求，为临床AI提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床试验中安全数据收集的时间窗口有限，且疫苗广泛接种后需要快速监测安全问题，因此需要开发高效的监测系统。

Method: 结合NLP和主动学习技术，利用急诊科分诊笔记中的专家信息，通过数据增强和主动学习优化模型训练。

Result: 开发了一种更准确、高效的分类器，能够从急诊科分诊笔记中识别潜在的疫苗安全问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为疫苗安全监测提供了一种快速、高效的方法，结合NLP和主动学习技术，显著提升了监测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

TL;DR: 研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，而在均匀设置下低于求和和最大值聚合GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与求和和最大值聚合GNNs进行比较。

Method: 在非均匀和均匀设置下分析均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与模态逻辑和MSO逻辑关联。

Result: 非均匀设置下均值GNNs表达能力高于最大值聚合但低于求和聚合；均匀设置下低于两者。

Conclusion: 均值聚合GNNs的表达能力受设置和假设条件影响，灵活性较高。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知归因框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）的知识与推理能力解耦，通过快速和慢速思维模式分析其贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分LLMs中的知识与推理能力对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要。

Method: 通过快速思维（知识检索）和慢速思维（推理调整）两种认知模式，量化知识与推理的贡献。

Result: 研究发现推理调整是领域特定的，参数扩展能提升知识和推理能力，且知识与推理分别分布在网络的不同层次。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解LLMs提供了新视角，并对现有研究如扩展定律、知识编辑和小模型推理的局限性提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Result: 证明三种方法（Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛）一致，且比Strongly Supported Models更强。

Conclusion: 这些方法为析提供了一种共同的非最小化语义，且比经典逻辑处理更强大。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Conclusion: 未来将开发正式模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Result: 在2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克竞赛的1500多份真实学生答案上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效自动化批改物理考试，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step

introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和RL算法中验证了IB正则化的有效性，推理性能一致提升。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，轻量级IB正则化方法简单高效，可无缝集成现有RL训练框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.
