TL;DR: 介绍了Gemini 2.X模型家族，包括Gemini 2.5 Pro、Gemini 2.5 Flash以及早期的Gemini 2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite模型。Gemini 2.5 Pro在编码和推理任务上表现卓越，支持多模态理解和长视频处理。Gemini 2.5 Flash提供高效推理能力，而2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite则以低延迟和低成本提供高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一系列模型以满足不同需求，覆盖从高性能到低成本的全范围应用场景。

Method: 推出Gemini 2.X模型家族，包括多个版本，分别优化了能力、计算成本和延迟。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在多模态理解和长视频处理上表现突出；Gemini 2.5 Flash提供高效推理；2.0 Flash和Flash-Lite在低成本和低延迟下保持高性能。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.X模型家族全面覆盖了能力与成本的平衡，为复杂问题解决提供了灵活选择。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

### [2] [Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06306)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在过度自信和用户过度依赖的问题，尤其在日语中不确定性标记较多，而德语和中文中确定性标记较多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在多语言环境中的安全性，特别是其校准性和用户依赖行为。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户在不同语言中对LLM生成内容的依赖率。

Result: LLMs在多语言中普遍过度自信，且用户对自信生成的依赖行为存在跨语言差异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准具有挑战性，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

### [3] [ETT: Expanding the Long Context Understanding Capability of LLMs at Test-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06313)
*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ETT的方法，通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度。实验表明，ETT可将上下文长度扩展至32倍，提升模型准确率30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长序列时面临二次计算和内存开销的问题，限制了其应用范围。

Method: ETT方法通过在测试时对输入上下文的子序列进行高效微调，扩展上下文长度，同时保持线性计算和恒定内存需求。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT成功将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。

Conclusion: ETT是一种高效扩展Transformer模型上下文长度的方法，尤其适合处理长序列任务。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型为统一形式、分布和接地语义理论提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何评估分词器质量，扩展了MorphScore以支持更多语言，并发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词是语言建模的关键步骤，但如何有效评估分词器质量尚不明确，尤其是分词边界是否与形态边界对齐。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，改进其灵活性，并分析形态对齐分数与下游任务性能的相关性。

Result: 形态对齐分数对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明形态对齐不足以衡量分词质量的模型相关维度。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键指标，需探索其他评估维度。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数学结构（如超岩浆和彩色操作）形式化句法理论中的核心概念，如头部、补足语、指示语和修饰语位置，以及相位结构。

Method: 使用超岩浆结构和彩色操作来描述句法对象的生成和过滤，并将句法规则（如内部合并、相位不可穿透条件等）纳入彩色操作的生成器形式中。

Result: 证明了句法结构的生成和过滤可以通过彩色操作等价地表述，并将相位结构与题元角色分配的运动兼容性形式化为彩色操作及其转换。

Conclusion: 通过数学结构成功形式化了句法理论中的复杂概念，为句法分析提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK是一种参数高效的方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码长上下文，显著优于基于提示的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文推理中现有元学习方法内存消耗过高的问题。

Method: 采用嵌套优化循环，内循环编码上下文到低秩适配器，外循环学习使用适配器进行推理。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，小模型提升90%，大模型提升27%。

Conclusion: PERK在训练时内存消耗高，但在推理时更高效，且对上下文复杂性、长度和相关信息位置更鲁棒。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

Motivation: 奖励模型（RM）在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效，现有方法依赖先验知识，实用性受限。

Method: 提出偏好分布无关的方法，通过奖励引导解码发现失败模式，并利用对抗样本改进奖励模型。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了奖励质量。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自我改进增强了奖励模型的鲁棒性，同时保持了性能并消除了虚假相关性。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Motivation: 传统大语言模型被视为黑盒算法，缺乏可解释性且性能提升受限，因此需要一种方法分解模型以增强信任和性能。

Method: 采用字典学习和稀疏自编码器的方法分解LLM，提取单义特征并自动修正模型内部误解。

Conclusion: 通过分解LLM并提取单义特征，可提升模型的可解释性和性能，为后续研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政策语言的演变对评估全球应对复杂挑战（如气候变化）至关重要，传统方法耗时且难以捕捉复杂性。

Method: 应用DETM模型分析1995至2023年UNFCCC政策决策的语料库，展示主题的时序动态。

Result: DETM揭示了政策重点从温室气体转向实施、技术合作、能力建设和全球协议，证明其可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: DETM是分析全球政策话语演变的有效工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Motivation: 当前RLVR在纯文本领域表现优异，但在多模态推理中因视觉输入感知不足而性能不佳。

Method: 提出PAPO，结合感知与推理学习，引入隐式感知损失（KL散度）优化GRPO目标。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中提升4.4%，视觉依赖任务提升8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为RLVR引入感知感知监督，为视觉基础推理的新RL框架奠定基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Result: 实验表明，基于增强数据训练的小型模型性能优于LLM，实现了高效、准确且可解释的时间归一化。

Conclusion: SCATE框架和LLM驱动的数据增强为时间归一化任务提供了新的解决方案，提升了性能和实用性。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Motivation: 解决Transformer在长序列处理中的二次复杂度和内存问题，同时探索线性注意力组件在混合架构中的选择。

Method: 训练并开源72个模型，涵盖六种线性注意力变体和五种混合比例，进行语言建模和召回任务基准测试。

Result: 语言建模稳定，召回性能在3:1以下比例显著提升；选择性门控、分层递归和可控遗忘对混合模型效果关键。

Conclusion: 推荐HGRN-2或GatedDeltaNet架构，线性与全注意力比例在3:1至6:1间，以实现高效Transformer级召回。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Conclusion: 亟需设计更鲁棒的置信度表达机制，因为即使是微小的语义保留修改也可能导致误导性置信度。

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在KV缓存缩减效果上优于基线方法，同时保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: SpindleKV为LLMs的KV缓存管理提供了高效且性能保持的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Conclusion: InvestAlign是一种有前景的方法，可解决复杂投资问题并提升LLM与投资者决策的对齐效果。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address

### [18] [Large Language Model for Extracting Complex Contract Information in Industrial Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06539)
*Yunyang Cao,Yanjun Li,Silong Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种工业场景中复杂合同信息提取任务的高质量数据集构建方法，并基于此微调大语言模型，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业合同信息提取任务需要高质量数据集，但传统方法难以满足复杂场景需求。

Method: 通过聚类分析、GPT-4和GPT-3.5标注关键信息，数据增强生成新文本，并微调大语言模型。

Result: 模型在召回率、精度和解析效率上表现优异，LoRA、数据平衡和数据增强有效提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业合同信息提取任务提供了高效新颖的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

### [19] [The Flaws of Others: An LLM-driven Framework for Scientific Knowledge Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565)
*Juan B. Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将人类与大型语言模型（LLM）视为平等节点的讨论网络模型，分析了四种无效性风险，并开发了一种数学模型和开源算法（FOO）来提升网络可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与LLM交互中的无效性问题（如事实、逻辑或结构错误），探索如何通过网络模型提升可靠性。

Method: 提出讨论网络模型，定义四种无效性风险（漂移、自我修复、新编造、外部检测），开发数学模型和开源算法FOO。

Result: 数学模型显示，仅漂移和自我修复时网络稳定于低错误率；加入编造后错误率升高；引入小概率同行评审可转向真相主导状态。

Conclusion: 可靠性源于将不完美模型连接成相互监督的网络，而非追求单一模型的完美。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

*Srihari K B,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个结合多模态知识图谱与生成式AI的食品领域QA框架，显著提升性能与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决食品领域QA中可靠性与多样性的问题，结合结构化知识与多模态生成技术。

Method: 构建大规模多模态知识图谱（MMKG），生成QA对，联合微调Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B和Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large，采用混合检索-生成策略。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率94.1%，合成充分性85%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成结合显著提升食品QA的可靠性与多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gated Memory Unit (GMU)的机制，用于在State Space Models (SSMs)层间高效共享内存，并基于此构建了SambaY架构，显著提升了解码效率和长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合架构如Samba和YOCO在序列建模中表现优异，但未探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构，结合Samba和YOCO的优势，并在跨解码器中共享内存状态。

Result: SambaY显著提升解码效率，保持线性预填充复杂度，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。最大模型在推理任务中性能显著优于基线。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构为高效序列建模提供了新思路，展示了在大规模计算下的优越性能扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuDoBa是一种基于贝叶斯优化的方法，结合LLM嵌入与领域特定知识，生成低维、任务相关的表示，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成的高维嵌入在领域特定应用中过于通用或低效的问题。

Method: 通过贝叶斯优化融合LLM嵌入与领域知识（本地和WikiData等外部资源），生成低维表示。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或与专有LLM嵌入基线相当。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效生成高效、可解释的表示，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议从证据源中提取数据的两种方法，发现其在简单数据上表现良好，但在复杂数据上准确性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过在线大语言模型（LLMs）和审查协议加速这一过程。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并对提取的数据进行审查。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据提取准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）。总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数较低。

Conclusion: 基于审查协议的方法需要更全面的性能评估，建议研究者在类似任务中评估并报告LLM表现。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是量化精英之间的相互敌意（极化），并分析其随时间的变化。

Method: 使用AI检测议会演讲中的发言者和被提及者，评估情感温度，构建精英极化指数。

Result: 结果显示该指数对选举活动、政党危机等事件敏感，具有良好的表面效度。

Conclusion: 该方法为欧盟范围内的精英极化时间序列研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLI-RAG框架通过分层分块和双阶段检索机制，解决了临床文本生成中的结构化和信息密度问题，显著提升了生成笔记的语义对齐和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本生成面临数据非结构化、分散且语义密集的挑战，传统提示方法难以应对。

Method: 提出CLI-RAG框架，采用分层分块策略和双阶段检索（全局识别相关笔记类型，局部提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上生成的结构化进度笔记，语义对齐得分87.7%，优于临床医生笔记的80.7%。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG在临床文本生成中表现优异，确保了确定性和可靠性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理确定和不确定预测时，其隐藏状态的动态变化基本一致，不确定性并未显著影响推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何内部表示和处理预测，以检测不确定性并防止幻觉。

Method: 使用Tuned Lens（Logit Lens的变体）分析11个数据集和5个模型的层间概率轨迹。

Result: 确定和不确定预测的轨迹一致，均在相似层突然增加置信度；但更优秀的模型可能学会不同方式处理不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究质疑了简单方法检测不确定性的可行性，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

Motivation: 探索KAConvText在句子分类任务中的有效性，特别是在处理不平衡数据和多类分类时的表现。

Method: 比较了随机和fastText嵌入的不同配置（静态和微调），并测试了KAConvText与MLP和KAN分类头的组合。

Result: KAConvText-MLP结合微调的fastText嵌入在三个任务中均取得最佳性能，最高准确率达99.82%。

Conclusion: KAConvText在句子分类任务中表现出色，尤其是结合微调嵌入和MLP分类头时。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

Result: 在多种语言和三个基准数据集上，CE-Judge表现优于基线模型，与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言评估方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）为企业应用提供了机会，但许多组织缺乏部署和维护大规模模型的基础设施，因此小规模模型（sLLMs）成为实用替代方案。然而，领域自适应持续预训练（DACP）在商业应用中的实用性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过在不同基础模型和服务领域应用DACP方法，进行广泛实验和实际评估。

Result: 实验表明，应用DACP的sLLMs在目标领域性能显著提升，同时保留通用能力。

Conclusion: DACP为sLLMs提供了一种成本高效且可扩展的企业级部署方案。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，适用于多种系统和领域，显著提升动态系统建模效率。

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Result: 语义熵（SE）能有效量化模型响应的语义多样性，并与准确性负相关。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和SE指标为推理扩展提供了更高效和协调的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重排序，难以满足复杂查询的信息需求，尤其是在多跳问答中。

Method: 提出SETR方法，利用Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的段落选择替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCoRE是一个模块化、低成本的句子级关系抽取系统，适应性强且抗噪声，结合对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器，性能优异且节能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足知识图谱（KG）扩展需求，适应低监督环境，并兼容预训练大语言模型（PLMs）。

Method: 采用监督对比学习和贝叶斯kNN分类器进行多标签分类，无需微调PLMs。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优异，能耗显著降低；模型复杂度增加会降低性能。

Conclusion: SCoRE结合高效性、模块化和可扩展性，是现实世界关系抽取应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

TL;DR: GUI代理（基于大型视觉语言模型）存在视觉定位漏洞，易受新型后门攻击（如VisualTrap），仅需5%毒化数据即可生效，且攻击具有跨环境泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示GUI代理在视觉定位中的安全漏洞，尤其是后门攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过毒化数据误导代理的视觉定位，攻击预训练阶段的视觉定位模块。

Result: 实验证明，仅需5%毒化数据和隐蔽视觉触发器即可成功攻击，且攻击可泛化至下游任务和不同GUI环境。

Conclusion: GUI代理的后门攻击风险亟需进一步研究。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Conclusion: 多被告和多罪名对法律判决预测有显著影响，需针对性优化模型。

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Method: 使用两种数学辅导对话数据集，评估Llama 3和GPT-4o在预测导师策略和学生表现上的能力。

Result: 即使最先进的大语言模型也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的方法来改进导师策略预测任务。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成评估套件的测试用例数量有限且同质化，导致性能评估不准确，影响强化学习框架的奖励估计。

Method: 提出多维度指标量化测试套件的全面性，并引入SAGA方法，结合人类编程经验和LLM推理能力，提升测试用例的覆盖率和质量。

Result: SAGA在TCGBench上的检测率为90.62%，验证器准确率为32.58%，优于LiveCodeBench-v6。

Conclusion: SAGA方法为可靠的LLM代码评估提供了可扩展的基础，推动了代码生成中强化学习的进展，并为自动化对抗测试和自适应基准集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）更新成本高且效率低，检索增强生成（RAG）虽能动态引入外部知识，但其性能高度依赖查询质量，因此需要研究其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过分析RAG流程中各组件对查询扰动的敏感性，并在端到端问答任务中测试通用和领域数据集，提出评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，常用检索器在轻微查询变化下性能显著下降，基于1092次实验提出了改进建议。

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询质量敏感，需优化检索模块以提高鲁棒性，论文提供的框架和建议有助于实践者改进系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

an interactive web interface for media analysts to explore and compare framing
across different sources, tackling the challenge of automatically detecting and
labeling how entities are framed. Our system allows end users to focus on a
single article as well as analyze up to four articles simultaneously. We
provide aggregate level analysis including an intuitive graph visualization
that highlights the narrative a group of articles are pushing. Our system
includes a search feature for users to look up entities of interest, along with
a timeline view that allows analysts to track an entity's role transitions
across different contexts within the article. The FRaN-X system and the trained

Result: 在31个任务上表现优异，平均提升41%，优于现有模型合并方法和标准MoE。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为敏感数据行业提供解决方案，支持数据本地化和细粒度访问控制。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Conclusion: MEWI是医疗教育高保真训练工具的重要进展，为联合部队的医疗撤离教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

Conclusion: PDL通过声明式表示和优化能力，显著提升了程序员的生产力和提示调优效果。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种方法将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架（AFs），并通过Baroni和Giacomin的标准评估其表现，发现方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SCC递归语义在无限AFs中因缺乏良好基础性而失效的问题，推动无限论证理论的发展。

Method: 提出两种扩展SCC递归语义的方法，并系统评估其在无限和有限AFs中的表现。

Result: 方向性在无限AFs中普遍失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为无限论证理论提供了新见解，并为处理无界或动态领域的推理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，通过分层标注、种子选择、数据合成和模型诊断生成高质量指令数据集，提升了模型的指令跟随能力和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集虽规模庞大，但在复杂指令和罕见领域任务上表现不佳，主要因覆盖面和深度不足。

Method: 采用分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型诊断生成，形成闭环迭代优化数据。

Result: 构建了InfinityInstruct-Subject数据集（150万指令），实验证明其提升模型性能，覆盖面和深度优于同类数据集。

Conclusion: 为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统无法应对现实世界中的动态变化和意外中断，导致用户体验不佳。本文旨在填补智能行程规划、精准导航和动态调整的空白。

Method: 设计了三个协作智能体：旅行规划智能体（基于网格空间和地图分析）、目的地助手智能体（提供精细导航）和本地发现智能体（利用图像嵌入和RAG技术应对中断）。

Result: 实验表明，系统在查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等多个领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题，需要更有效的探索方法。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，通过识别高不确定性决策点并进行针对性探索，构建语义基础的中期反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E提升了训练稳定性、生成长且连贯的响应，并增加了完全正确轨迹的比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过结构化探索有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探索了声音中的“可爱”（kawaii）元素及其可操作性，通过实验验证了声音频率对可爱感知的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注视觉上的可爱，而声音方面的可爱研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用四阶段实验（N=512），分析文本转语音（TTS）和游戏角色声音的频率调整对可爱感知的影响。

Result: 发现某些声音的频率调整存在“可爱点”，但效果有限且存在天花板效应。

Conclusion: 初步验证了可爱声音模型，并提供了操纵计算机声音可爱感知的基本方法。

Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural
connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet,
virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including
in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the
new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to
kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We
conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer
voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet
spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only
for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling
effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation
of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for
manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

### [54] [Ragged Blocks: Rendering Structured Text with Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06460)
*Sam Cohen,Ravi Chugh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的文本布局算法，通过生成不规则的多边形块（ragged blocks）来嵌套装饰文本，同时最小化对底层排版布局的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本可视化仅限于扁平化的行装饰或嵌套盒子，前者信息有限，后者破坏排版布局。缺乏丰富的样式选项限制了文本显示的信息种类。

Method: 提出一种布局算法，生成不规则多边形块（rocks），支持嵌套文本的紧凑渲染，即使带有边框和内边距。

Result: 在多种编程语言的源代码文件上测试，算法生成的布局比传统矩形块布局更紧凑。通过使用场景展示，未来GUI可通过域特定样式传达丰富语义信息。

Conclusion: 该算法能够在不破坏排版的前提下实现任意嵌套装饰，为未来文本可视化提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Whether it be source code in a programming language, prose in natural
language, or otherwise, text is highly structured. Currently, text
visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can
convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_,
which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the
underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits
the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be
displayed.
  In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested
decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout.
Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or
_rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly
rendered even when styled with borders and padding.
  We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite
comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages,
we show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are
substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by
conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax
tree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage
scenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other
document-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through
domain-specific styling of ragged blocks.

Method: 采用混合方法评估54名参与者与基于大型语言模型和文本转语音合成的动漫风格代理的互动，分析用户参与度、感知可用性、情感反应和学习行为。

Result: 代理的设计（尤其是声音、人设和语言风格）显著影响用户体验、动机和学习策略。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更具吸引力和社会响应性的系统提供了指导，并深化了对情感化、文化风格化代理在人际互动中作用的理解。

Abstract: This study investigates how stylized, voiced agents shape user interaction in
a multimodal language learning environment. We conducted a mixed-methods
evaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters
powered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These
agents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,
semi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We
analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,
and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization
influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural
backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,
and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and
strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally
stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing
more engaging, socially responsive systems.

Abstract: As conspiracy theories gain traction, it has become crucial to research
effective intervention strategies that can foster evidence and science-based
discussions in conspiracy theory communities online. This study presents a
novel framework using insider language to contest conspiracy theory ideology in
climate change denialism on Reddit. Focusing on discussions in two Reddit
communities, our research investigates reactions to pro-social and
evidence-based intervention messages for two cohorts of users: climate change
deniers and climate change supporters. Specifically, we combine manual and
generative AI-based methods to craft intervention messages and deploy the
interventions as replies on Reddit posts and comments through transparently
labeled bot accounts. On the one hand, we find that evidence-based
interventions with neutral language foster positive engagement, encouraging
open discussions among believers of climate change denialism. On the other,
climate change supporters respond positively, actively participating and
presenting additional evidence. Our study contributes valuable insights into
the process and challenges of automatically delivering interventions in
conspiracy theory communities on social media, and helps inform future research
on social media interventions.

Method: 开发一款结合无标记动作捕捉的实时运动游戏应用，利用AI姿态估计技术。

Result: 当前技术面临实时性与准确性平衡、用户体验优化等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需优化AI模型、改进游戏设计和用户交互，以推广智能手机运动游戏的应用。

Abstract: Markerless Motion Capture (MoCap) using smartphone cameras is a promising
approach to making exergames more accessible and cost-effective for health and
rehabilitation. Unlike traditional systems requiring specialized hardware,
recent advancements in AI-powered pose estimation enable movement tracking
using only a mobile device. For an upcoming study, a mobile application with
real-time exergames including markerless motion capture is being developed.
However, implementing such technology introduces key challenges, including
balancing accuracy and real-time responsiveness, ensuring proper user
interaction. Future research should explore optimizing AI models for realtime
performance, integrating adaptive gamification, and refining user-centered
design principles. By overcoming these challenges, smartphone-based exergames
could become powerful tools for engaging users in physical activity and
rehabilitation, extending their benefits to a broader audience.

Method: 32名参与者在三种难度下玩Beat Saber，通过问卷和生理数据测量CL与准确性，使用回归分析。

Result: 音乐训练显著提高任务准确性，但未显著影响主观CL；游戏经验和任务难度显著预测主观CL。

Conclusion: 音乐训练对任务表现有积极影响，但需进一步研究音乐专长分类及流状态和自我效能的作用。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between musical training, cognitive load
(CL), and task accuracy within the virtual reality (VR) exergame Beat Saber
across increasing levels of difficulty. Participants (N=32) completed a series
of post-task questionnaires after playing the game under three task difficulty
levels while having their physiological data measured by an Emotibit. Using
regression analyses, we found that task difficulty and gaming experience
significantly predicted subjective CL, whereas musical training did not.
However, musical training significantly predicted higher task accuracy, along
with lower subjective CL, increased gaming experience, and greater
physiological arousal. These results suggest that musical training enhances
task-specific performance but does not directly reduce subjective CL. Future
research should consider alternative methods of grouping musical expertise and
the additional predictability of flow and self-efficacy.

Conclusion: CSOs应成为技术开发的合作伙伴，以确保工具符合实际需求。

Abstract: The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online
content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their
investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and
monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer
seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures.
Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content,
CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing
feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder
needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations
between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and
research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by
civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be
meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of
anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in
collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAP的无参数方法，用于解决深度学习在实时脑机接口中的三大挑战：离线到在线的转换、计算复杂性和数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在离线脑机接口中表现优异，但在实时应用中面临挑战，如计算复杂性高和数据需求大。

Method: 引入RAP方法，通过调整现有离线模型的池化层以适应在线解码，并利用源自由域适应减少数据需求。

Result: RAP在实时脑机接口中表现稳健高效，保护隐私并减少校准需求。

Conclusion: RAP为深度学习在在线脑机接口中的广泛应用奠定了基础，支持用户中心的高性能系统。

Abstract: Despite the growing success of deep learning (DL) in offline brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs), its adoption in real-time applications remains limited due
to three primary challenges. First, most DL solutions are designed for offline
decoding, making the transition to online decoding unclear. Second, the use of
sliding windows in online decoding substantially increases computational
complexity. Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data,
which are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and
enable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration,
we introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method.
RAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to
meet online decoding requirements. It also reduces computational complexity
during training by jointly decoding consecutive sliding windows. To further
alleviate data requirements, our method leverages source-free domain
adaptation, enabling privacy-preserving adaptation across varying amounts of
target data. Our results demonstrate that RAP provides a robust and efficient
framework for real-time BCI applications. It preserves privacy, reduces
calibration demands, and supports co-adaptive BCI systems, paving the way for
broader adoption of DL in online BCIs. These findings lay a strong foundation
for developing user-centered, high-performance BCIs that facilitate immediate
feedback and user learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合系统思维、人机交互设计、AI/ML和隐私优先自适应代理的框架，以支持ADHD用户在数字工作环境中的注意力管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对ADHD患者在IT和知识密集型工作中面临的注意力分散、时间管理困难等问题，传统工具无法满足其需求，因此需要开发更有效的干预措施。

Method: 采用系统思维和人机交互设计，结合AI/ML技术，通过设备端机器学习感知用户行为（如标签使用、应用焦点等），推断注意力状态并提供非干扰性干预（如提示、陪伴等）。

Result: 开发了一个可复制的自适应支持工具模型，适用于高干扰工作环境，帮助ADHD用户更好地管理注意力。

Conclusion: 该框架为ADHD用户提供了一种隐私优先、非干扰性的支持工具，有望在高干扰工作环境中推广使用。

Abstract: Digital work environments in IT and knowledge-based sectors demand high
levels of attention management, task juggling, and self-regulation. For adults
with ADHD, these settings often amplify challenges such as time blindness,
digital distraction, emotional reactivity, and executive dysfunction. These
individuals prefer low-touch, easy-to-use interventions for daily tasks.
Conventional productivity tools often fail to support the cognitive variability
and overload experienced by neurodivergent professionals. This paper presents a
framework that blends Systems Thinking, Human-in-the-Loop design, AI/ML, and
privacy-first adaptive agents to support ADHD-affected users. The assistant
senses tab usage, application focus, and inactivity using on-device ML. These
cues are used to infer attention states and deliver nudges, reflective prompts,
or accountability-based presence (body doubling) that aid regulation without
disruption. Technically grounded in AI, the approach views attention as shaped
by dynamic feedback loops. The result is a replicable model for adaptive,
inclusive support tools in high-distraction work environments.

Motivation: 非自治微分方程在建模受外部信号影响的系统时至关重要，但当信号突变时，拟合模型变得困难。

Method: HADES-NN分两阶段：1) 用神经网络平滑逼近不连续信号；2) 用平滑信号估计模型参数。

Result: HADES-NN在多种应用中提供了高精度参数估计，如昼夜节律系统和酵母交配响应。

Conclusion: HADES-NN显著扩展了可拟合实际测量数据的模型范围。

Abstract: Non-autonomous differential equations are crucial for modeling systems
influenced by external signals, yet fitting these models to data becomes
particularly challenging when the signals change abruptly. To address this
problem, we propose a novel parameter estimation method utilizing functional
approximations with artificial neural networks. Our approach, termed Harmonic
Approximation of Discontinuous External Signals using Neural Networks
(HADES-NN), operates in two iterated stages. In the first stage, the algorithm
employs a neural network to approximate the discontinuous signal with a smooth
function. In the second stage, it uses this smooth approximate signal to
estimate model parameters. HADES-NN gives highly accurate and precise parameter
estimates across various applications, including circadian clock systems
regulated by external light inputs measured via wearable devices and the mating
response of yeast to external pheromone signals. HADES-NN greatly extends the
range of model systems that can be fit to real-world measurements.

Motivation: 传统DBS缺乏适应性和个性化，现有RL方法存在样本复杂度高和硬件限制问题。

Result: 在帕金森病基底节模拟中，SEA-DBS表现出更快的收敛速度、更强的病理β波段抑制能力以及对FP16量化的适应性。

Conclusion: SEA-DBS为资源受限的实时神经调控提供了一种实用且有效的RL框架。

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic

recovering these symbolic expressions, advancing automated discovery in

TL;DR: 论文提出DecoyDB数据集和定制化GCL框架，用于提升蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测因缺乏大规模高质量标记数据而受限，现有数据集如PDBbind规模较小。自监督学习（尤其是图对比学习）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 构建DecoyDB数据集，包含高分辨率真实复合物和多样性诱饵结构，并设计定制化GCL框架进行预训练和微调。

Result: 实验表明，基于DecoyDB预训练的模型在准确性、标签效率和泛化性上表现优越。

Conclusion: DecoyDB和定制化GCL框架为蛋白质-配体结合亲和力预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital
role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack
of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used
PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,
especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to
break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast
unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.
However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a
comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex
pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique
characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a
large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised
GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground
truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with
computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal
(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation
(RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to
pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with
labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with
DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.

Method: 分析参数空间的梯度流，并将其表示为函数空间的黎曼梯度流，适用于多维卷积和特定步长条件。

Result: 证明了梯度流可以表示为黎曼梯度流，且黎曼度量依赖于初始化。

Conclusion: 该结果为理解线性卷积网络的优化提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear
convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown
recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written
as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight
matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition.
We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear
convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function
space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional
convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides
of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric
depends on the initialization.

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提升能效，适用于资源受限的边缘应用。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Conclusion: 论文证明了深度学习模型在ECG篡改检测和身份验证中的高效性，尤其是混合模型表现最佳。

Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health
monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is
becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,
ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also
evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity
verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment
substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.
The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional
representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54
subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings
while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental
results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,
FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding
99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent
from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B
substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable
performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity
verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy
of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model
delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中罕见疾病因数据稀缺和异质性而服务不足，需要一种有效的方法来支持临床决策。

Method: KnowRare通过自监督预训练学习条件无关表示，并利用条件知识图选择性适应临床相似条件的知识。

Result: 在五项临床预测任务中，KnowRare表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统，并展示了灵活性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: KnowRare是支持ICU罕见疾病临床决策的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

Motivation: EEG信号易受伪迹干扰，影响自动睡眠分期的准确性，需要一种可靠的方法来检测和过滤伪迹。

Method: 开发了eegUsability机器学习模型，基于15名参与者127晚的手动标记EEG数据进行训练和评估。

Conclusion: eegFloss通过检测伪迹和提供附加功能，提高了睡眠研究的精确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

Result: 发现当分布内注意力呈现层次模式时，模型在OOD数据上更可能表现出层次化泛化行为。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性在预测模型未见行为方面的应用提供了概念验证，鼓励进一步探索。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their
internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first
automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically
grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on
sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of
thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to
diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron
activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,
enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and
instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,
including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that
analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws
and a structured neuron space distribution.

Conclusion: 该算法为高能耗问题提供了有效解决方案，适合硬件加速实现。

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine
learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to
larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main
algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant
challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial
dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for
the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;
here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this
study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.
Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing
operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,
combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the
information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and
expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be
implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of
unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to
real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one
order of magnitude.

Motivation: Adam在训练深度神经网络中表现优异，但其成功机制和局限性尚未充分研究。本研究旨在揭示Adam的优势与不足，并提出改进方案。

Method: 提出SignSoftSGD（S3），采用p阶动量、统一动量系数和Nesterov加速模块，优化训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Result: S3在多种任务中表现优于Adam，收敛更快且损失波动更少，甚至能在10倍学习率下稳定训练。

Conclusion: S3在效率和最终性能上均优于Adam，为深度学习的优化器设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but
the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain
underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam
stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large
gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes
due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and
mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with
three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by
employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator,
departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)
preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving
stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3
minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving
average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently
bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3
incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,
accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that
S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic
optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of
vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more
rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even
with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers
performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the
training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task
performance.

Result: 在Car Tag任务中超越人类设计的策略，在Gandalf任务中成功突破LLM的防御并修补漏洞。

Conclusion: FMSP为自博弈算法提供了新的研究方向，推动了更开放和创新的策略发现。

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud
detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node
representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the
focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global
topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being
overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign
nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class
imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of
imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior
obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,
we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate
Message imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a
topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation
learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient
propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust
node representations, enhancing the stable association between node
representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.
Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the
results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud
detection.

Conclusion: FedDifRC通过扩散表示协作成功缓解数据异构性，为联邦学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across
participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this
paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across
multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this
paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning
paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during
federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion
representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel
diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation
Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion
models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven
diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to
provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence
signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the
diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive
learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency
regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising
representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In
addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying
on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to
ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different
scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: MoFE-Time在理论和实践中均表现出色，验证了其在复杂时间序列预测中的有效性。

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal
role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture
for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing
models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency
characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal
performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling
periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an
innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency
domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the
pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively
transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets
with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency
and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing
mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input
signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared
to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation
benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from
real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this
dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical
commercial applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated probability estimates,
leading to overconfident predictions. A common approach for calibration is
fitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms
predicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is
instance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability
outputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee
monotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized
calibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural
networks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose
a family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a
constrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number
of classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and
interpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability
output by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained
optimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance
across datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming
existing calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient. Our

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上实验验证有效性，隐私预算下性能接近或超过非隐私模型。

Conclusion: AdaDPIGU通过自适应稀疏化同时提升隐私性和实用性。

Abstract: Differential privacy has been proven effective for stochastic gradient
descent; however, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in
high-dimensional settings, as the scale of injected noise increases with
dimensionality. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new
differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates
tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a
differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each
parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune
low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping
mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically,
we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy
and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported
under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test
accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching
the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at
$\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating
that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate
hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying
function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a
novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model
and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and
acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our
framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying
hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an
acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a
Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing
multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision
transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving
the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning
paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated
data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real
evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO
baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust
exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is
crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the
scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the
inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to
learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these
limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning
framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to
enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs
a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through
hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale
data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax
cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution
disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic
estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and
ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS
designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the
$R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score
gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is

Conclusion: LoRAM通过幅度驱动的方法，实现了高效且高性能的模型调优，为LoRA提供了更好的初始化策略。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning
large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence
and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra
computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we
establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and
propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that
matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions
are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove
low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying
hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as
mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization
succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed
knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the
boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization
strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight
magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM
serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while
matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from
graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However,
training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the
scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present
CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS
circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the
coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link
prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a
small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph.
Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer.
Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that
summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph.
CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and
reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to
existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling
direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.
Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models
for representation learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work
has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we
investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO
(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive
optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best
leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than
simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human
problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation
method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations
to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired
by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current
capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that
adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We
estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of
per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and
de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster
convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional
parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by
limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication
should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently
devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating
communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly
improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected
communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is
sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show
that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the
\textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical
contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the
globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized
mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy
among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as
constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the
common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data
heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model
merging and neural network loss landscapes.

Abstract: Environments with controllable dynamics are usually understood in terms of

sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate
using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine

methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies
to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable
dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic

Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized.
The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and
post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design
parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the
parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware
pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage
model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model
combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in
SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant
internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to
abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM
designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in
parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also
significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

Conclusion: 新框架在解耦和生成质量上表现优异，支持潜在空间的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

Conclusion: CTPG是一种通用框架，能有效利用跨任务相似性，提升多任务强化学习性能。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared
information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with
carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures.
However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task
similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills
can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills
acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy
Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the
behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control
policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two
gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters
out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate
blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework
adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly
enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，GO-Skill在多样机器人操作任务中表现出高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: GO-Skill通过技能抽象和分层策略学习，有效解决了离线多任务强化学习中的知识共享问题。

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy
capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets,
without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it
faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks.
Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we
propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed
to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task
performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented
skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a
discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable
and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the
extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical
policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that
dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks.
Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the
MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

Motivation: 解决观测数据中个体治疗效果估计问题，现有方法难以精确分解协变量，导致因果关系建模不准确。

Method: 结合混合专家模型、多头注意力机制、线性正交正则化器和重要性采样重加权技术，软分解预处理变量并消除选择偏差。

Result: 在公开半合成和真实数据集上实验表明，算法优于现有个体治疗效果估计方法。

Conclusion: 新算法通过软分解和偏差消除，显著提升个体治疗效果估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention
in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we
concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown
promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental,
confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has
primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for
covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely
disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal
relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that
incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear
orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and
simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting
techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and
real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on
individual treatment effects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的通用框架，用于解决现代无线接入网络（RAN）中的动态和异构环境问题，通过注意力图表示和域随机化提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RAN环境动态且异构，传统基于规则的算法表现不佳，数据驱动策略容易过拟合，需要一种能泛化的强化学习方法。

Method: 采用注意力图表示编码拓扑和节点属性，结合域随机化扩展训练分布，并通过分布式数据生成和集中训练架构提升效率。

Result: 在5G基准测试中，平均吞吐量和频谱效率提升10%-20%，在多场景下优于基线方法，GAT模型在九小区部署中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI原生6G RAN提供了一条可行路径，通过单一通用强化学习代理实现高性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where
hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass
such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and
unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges.
Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading
performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a
generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell
topology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii)
applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii)
distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training
in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although
generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our
distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training
across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five
5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency
by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and
by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic
and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks,
respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput
over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture,
offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

Motivation: 医疗图像分类中数据泄漏问题严重，现有方法（如差分隐私）在大数据集上有效，但在小规模不平衡数据集（如HAM10000）上表现不佳，导致模型陷入次优解。

Method: 提出SAD-DPSGD方法，采用线性衰减机制动态调整噪声和裁剪阈值，初始阶段分配更多隐私预算和更高裁剪阈值，避免模型陷入次优解。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集上，SAD-DPSGD优于Auto-DPSGD，在$\epsilon = 3.0$、$\delta = 10^{-3}$下准确率提升2.15%。

Conclusion: SAD-DPSGD有效解决了小规模不平衡医疗数据集上的数据泄漏问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: When applying machine learning to medical image classification, data leakage
is a critical issue. Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for
differential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but
fail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the
imbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped
and lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate. This leads the
model to fall into suboptimal solutions early. To address this, we propose
SAD-DPSGD, which uses a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping
thresholds. By allocating more privacy budget and using higher clipping
thresholds in the initial training phases, the model avoids suboptimal
solutions and enhances performance. Experiments show that SAD-DPSGD outperforms
Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, improving accuracy by 2.15% under $\epsilon = 3.0$ ,
$\delta = 10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: UniOD避免了模型选择和超参数调优的麻烦，降低了计算成本，并有效利用历史数据集的知识，提升了实际应用的便利性和准确性。

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) seeks to distinguish inliers and outliers in
completely unlabeled datasets and plays a vital role in science and
engineering. Most existing OD methods require troublesome dataset-specific
hyperparameter tuning and costly model training before they can be deployed to
identify outliers. In this work, we propose UniOD, a universal OD framework
that leverages labeled datasets to train a single model capable of detecting
outliers of datasets from diverse domains. Specifically, UniOD converts each
dataset into multiple graphs, produces consistent node features, and frames
outlier detection as a node-classification task, and is able to generalize to
unseen domains. As a result, UniOD avoids effort on model selection and
hyperparameter tuning, reduces computational cost, and effectively utilizes the
knowledge from historical datasets, which improves the convenience and accuracy
in real applications. We evaluate UniOD on 15 benchmark OD datasets against 15
state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Result: 通过最小化模型熵，有效减少了不希望的振荡，且无需从训练数据中分离测试点。

Conclusion: 该方法在网格数据回归任务中有效预防过拟合，并通过拉普拉斯算子提供了一种替代测试指标。

Abstract: This document reports on a method for detecting and preventing overfitting on
data regressions, herein applied to mesh-like data structures. The mesh
structure allows for the straightforward computation of the Laplace-operator
second-order derivatives in a finite-difference fashion for noiseless data.
Derivatives of the training data are computed on the original training mesh to
serve as a true label of the entropy of the training data. Derivatives of the
trained data are computed on a staggered mesh to identify oscillations in the
interior of the original training mesh cells. The loss of the Laplace-operator
derivatives is used for hyperparameter optimisation, achieving a reduction of
unwanted oscillation through the minimisation of the entropy of the trained
model. In this setup, testing does not require the splitting of points from the
training data, and training is thus directly performed on all available
training points. The Laplace operator applied to the trained data on a
staggered mesh serves as a surrogate testing metric based on diffusion
properties.

Conclusion: LIVAR证明仅通过现有训练信号即可实现高效模型聚合，为联邦学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches
for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone
parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our
method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during
standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based
merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation
scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an
explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing
update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless
integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective
model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals,
establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Furthermore, we also provide our code as an open-source library, which

Abstract: Fuzzy systems are a way to allow machines, systems and frameworks to deal
with uncertainty, which is not possible in binary systems that most computers
use. These systems have already been deployed for certain use cases, and fuzzy
systems could be further improved as proposed in this paper. Such technologies
to draw inspiration from include machine learning and federated learning.
Machine learning is one of the recent breakthroughs of technology and could be
applied to fuzzy systems to further improve the results it produces. Federated
learning is also one of the recent technologies that have huge potential, which
allows machine learning training to improve by reducing privacy risk, reducing
burden on networking infrastructure, and reducing latency of the latest model.
Aspects from federated learning could be used to improve federated learning,
such as applying the idea of updating the fuzzy rules that make up a key part
of fuzzy systems, to further improve it over time. This paper discusses how
these improvements would be implemented in fuzzy systems, and how it would
improve fuzzy systems. It also discusses certain limitations on the potential
improvements. It concludes that these proposed ideas and improvements require
further investigation to see how far the improvements are, but the potential is
there to improve fuzzy systems.

Method: 采用跨注意力融合生理数据，设计基于最优传输的异质性挖掘模块，引入可学习标签嵌入和标签相关性驱动的跨注意力机制。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: HeLo框架在多模态情感分布学习中表现出色，有效解决了现有方法的挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays
a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since
different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with
single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that
identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.
However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among
multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic
emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring
the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data
and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt
cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal
transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the
interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral
representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a
learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,
the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated
with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven
cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

Motivation: 现代电力系统因可再生能源和分布式能源的引入而变得复杂，需可靠预测短期状态以确保稳定运行。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在归一化均方根误差上平均优于传统基线35.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多域、多速率电力系统状态预测中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable
operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing
variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these
systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict
their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control
decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.
Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges
for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state
forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor
networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate
information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are
designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are
typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts
their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly
encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy
conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous
Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both
homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among
sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -
which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on
average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its
effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更稳健、实用的IfO技术提供了有价值的见解，推动了可扩展行为学习的进展。

Abstract: Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn
behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement
learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the
need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However,
current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality
data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast,
this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to
learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning
can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based
imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to
transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and
the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established
methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.

Conclusion: DiffSpectra首次统一了多模态光谱推理和2D/3D生成建模，为分子结构解析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in
control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy
measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive
Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state
estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers,
which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed
framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a
physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal
gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system
states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence
guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error
minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs
is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear
systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and
benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing

TL;DR: 论文提出ReMix方法，通过混合策略和策略重生技术，显著降低强化学习微调的计算和时间成本，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习微调方法多为在线策略，数据利用率低，计算和时间成本高，限制了经济高效的扩展。

Method: 提出ReMix方法，包括混合策略近端策略梯度、KL凸约束和策略重生技术，以利用离线数据。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，ReMix表现优异，训练成本降低30x至450x，性能达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: ReMix通过高效利用离线数据，显著提升了强化学习微调的经济性和性能，揭示了离线策略差异的潜在影响。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在解决微分方程时面临标记数据成本高或效率-精度权衡的局限，MAD框架旨在克服这些限制。

Method: MAD框架利用微分方程的数学结构生成物理嵌入的解析解和合成数据，无需实验或模拟数据。

Result: 在2D参数问题中，MAD展示了其通用性和高效性/准确性，适用于复杂参数空间。

Conclusion: MAD框架有望成为科学计算中物理信息机器智能的通用范式。

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving
differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained
by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while
model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This
physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex
parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for
physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.

*Enda D. V. Bigarella*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的参数化激活函数（Leaky Exponential Linear Unit），旨在改善多维非线性数据回归性能，并通过新的扩散损失指标评估模型过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性激活函数对学习非线性数据集至关重要，但其平滑性和梯度特性会影响大型神经网络的性能，如过拟合和模型参数敏感性。

Method: 提出平滑且具有非零梯度的Leaky Exponential Linear Unit激活函数，并引入扩散损失指标评估模型性能。

Result: 新激活函数在性能上优于传统平滑但梯度消失的激活函数（如ELU、SiLU）和非平滑激活函数（如RELU、Leaky-RELU）。

Conclusion: 平滑且具有非零梯度的激活函数能显著提升模型性能，扩散损失指标为评估过拟合提供了新方法。

Abstract: This document proposes a parametric activation function (ac.f.) aimed at
improving multidimensional nonlinear data regression. It is a established
knowledge that nonlinear ac.f.'s are required for learning nonlinear datasets.
This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further
impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and
sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f.'s such as
ELU or SiLU have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f.'s such as RELU and
Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved
performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with
non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also
proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of
overfitting.

Conclusion: 新框架提供了更实用的拓扑泛化边界，解释了其经验成功，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms is
a major challenge in modern learning theory. Recently, several studies
highlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the
generalization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a
series of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the
generalization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from
topological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds
rely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in
specific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),
potentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we
seek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization
bounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce
a novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies
via proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing
notion of \textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \textit{trajectory stability},
we prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be
upper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the
trajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory
stability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental
evaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great
importance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately
forms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization
bounds.

Conclusion: 该方法在模仿学习中结合约束和熵最大化，具有泛化能力和稳定性。

Abstract: This article introduces an imitation learning method for learning maximum
entropy policies that comply with constraints demonstrated by expert
trajectories executing a task. The formulation of the method takes advantage of
results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between
demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified
through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement
learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective
to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed
algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent,
supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed
method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in
settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different
modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.

Abstract: Speech tokenization is crucial in digital speech processing, converting
continuous speech signals into discrete units for various computational tasks.
This paper introduces a novel speech tokenizer with broad applicability across
downstream tasks. While recent advances in residual vector quantization (RVQ)
have incorporated semantic elements, they often neglect critical acoustic
features. We propose an advanced approach that simultaneously encodes both
linguistic and acoustic information, preserving prosodic and emotional content.
Our method significantly enhances speech representation fidelity across diverse
applications. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness in speech
coding, voice conversion, emotion recognition, and multimodal language
modeling, without requiring additional training. This versatility underscores
its potential as a key tool for advancing AI-driven speech processing.

Conclusion: 基础模型可能仅发展出任务特定的启发式方法，而未能实现真正的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了在噪声数据下，物理信息神经网络（PINNs）逼近偏微分方程（PDE）解的条件，证明了网络规模与监督数据噪声方差的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，数据通常带有噪声，但目前对PINNs在噪声条件下有效性的理解不足。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明了神经网络规模与监督数据噪声方差的下界关系，并通过实验验证了PINNs在噪声条件下能达到低经验风险。

Result: 理论结果表明，网络参数数量需满足特定条件才能降低经验风险，且增加噪声监督数据并不能无代价地减少风险。实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 研究为理解噪声条件下训练PINNs的参数需求奠定了基础，并强调了网络规模的重要性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate
solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high
dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is
important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.
However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so
effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for
the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy
supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk
$O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily
$d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$
is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies
to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled
noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone
does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show
empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$
under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for
quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in
the presence of noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于假设检验解释的差分隐私（$f$-DP）方法，统一了重识别、属性推断和数据重建风险的攻击成功界限，提供了更紧致的隐私风险评估和噪声校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私机制在隐私参数映射到具体风险（如重识别、属性推断和数据重建）时过于悲观且不一致，需要一种更统一和可调的方法。

Method: 使用$f$-DP的假设检验解释，推导出攻击成功界限的统一形式，适用于多种攻击场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比$\varepsilon$-DP、Rényi DP和集中DP更紧致，噪声校准可减少20%的噪声需求，并在文本分类任务中提高15%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为差分隐私的保护程度提供了统一的解释和校准框架，适用于具体风险水平的评估。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary
(including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp
accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和法规限制，真实EHR数据难以共享和使用，因此需要生成合成数据。现有方法通常仅生成专家选择的特征，无法完全模拟原始EHR的复杂性。

Method: RawMed采用基于文本的表示和压缩技术，无需过多预处理即可捕捉复杂结构和时间动态。

Result: 在开源EHR数据集上验证，RawMed在保真度和实用性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RawMed为多表时间序列EHR数据合成提供了新方法，并通过新评估框架验证了其性能。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at

Method: 结合迭代线性系统求解器和路径条件技术，将昂贵计算转化为线性方程组求解。

Result: 显著降低了内存需求，适用于更大规模数据，并优化了现代硬件的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程在现代大规模应用中的使用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a powerful framework for uncertainty-aware function
approximation and sequential decision-making. Unfortunately, their classical
formulation does not scale gracefully to large amounts of data and modern
hardware for massively-parallel computation, prompting many researchers to
develop techniques which improve their scalability. This dissertation focuses
on the powerful combination of iterative methods and pathwise conditioning to
develop methodological contributions which facilitate the use of Gaussian
processes in modern large-scale settings. By combining these two techniques
synergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems
of linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.
This drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to
significantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as
the main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.

Motivation: 现有折叠模型依赖多序列比对（MSA），但在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质上效果有限，PLAME旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PLAME引入预训练表示增强进化信息，采用保守-多样性损失提升生成质量，并提出新的MSA筛选方法和序列质量评估指标。

Result: 在AlphaFold2和AlphaFold3基准测试中，PLAME在折叠增强和序列质量评估上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PLAME不仅提升了预测质量，还能作为适配器实现AlphaFold2级精度与ESMFold的推理速度。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文BwK问题提供了新的解决方案，特别是在未标记特征数据的情况下。

Abstract: We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with
contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These
episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability
distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same
latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a
request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications
such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment,
and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets.
We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the
number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that
achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing
contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with
arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning
problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret
bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data,
which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.

Abstract: Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between
entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and
numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal
structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings.
However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain
data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables
can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the
information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we
comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both
horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification
theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and
vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first
aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to
construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for
recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength
matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but
also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm
demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic
data and real-world data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据流（如IoT、金融市场）的高速度、无界性和复杂依赖性带来了挑战，传统固定窗口难以适应动态变化。

Method: 将窗口大小选择建模为强化学习问题，使用Dueling DQN和优先经验回放来学习自适应策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，RL-Window在分类准确性、漂移鲁棒性和计算效率上优于现有方法（如ADWIN和CNN-Adaptive）。

Conclusion: RL-Window具有适应性和稳定性，适用于实时应用，并通过扩展指标（如能效、延迟）进一步验证了其优势。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial
markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high
velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding
window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size
windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty
patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based
approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional
data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable
an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as
variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a
Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle
non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
(UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms
state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification
accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional
qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and
a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and
stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML)
framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our
approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential
safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs.
We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various
voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the
robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DICE的方法，用于在去中心化网络中估计数据影响力传播，以解决激励机制中公平贡献分配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习虽能分布式处理数据和计算任务，但缺乏公平激励机制，影响参与积极性。

Method: 设计了DICE方法，通过理论推导近似计算影响力在任意邻居跳数间的传播，考虑数据、通信拓扑和损失景观曲率的相互作用。

Result: DICE为选择合适合作者和识别恶意行为提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: DICE是首个在去中心化环境中估计数据影响力传播的方法，为公平激励机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data
consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed
compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the
exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in
absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair
incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to
participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the
localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network.
To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized
environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of
influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence
cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the
curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications
including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的损失函数MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL，解决了多视图对比学习中存在的四个关键问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在处理多视图时存在优化冲突、交互建模不足、继承局限性及无法充分利用视图多样性等问题。

Method: 提出MV-InfoNCE和MV-DHEL两种损失函数，前者整合所有视图交互，后者解耦对齐与均匀性。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上表现优于现有方法，且能扩展到多模态数据。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了多视图对比学习的局限性，并展示了其在监督学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

Result: 精确分析了理论与实际解之间的差异，并比较了文献中的不同算法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为扩散模型在逆问题中的性能提供了量化评估。

Abstract: Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently
attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high
variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as
inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved
questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate
the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for
deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze
the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and
their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact
Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler
and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings
allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to
traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich
representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more
broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of
data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and
efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs
between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how
different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy
budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations
under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy
costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may
assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve
competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X,
underscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种集成嵌入方法，通过结合多个嵌入模型和训练的元编码器，提升LLM缓存系统中的语义相似性检测能力，显著优于单模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存框架依赖单一嵌入模型，无法充分捕捉真实查询分布中的多样语义关系，限制了缓存效率。

Method: 采用集成嵌入方法，结合多个嵌入模型并通过训练的元编码器优化语义相似性检测。

Result: 在QQP数据集上，集成方法实现了92%的缓存命中率和85%的非等价查询拒绝准确率。

Conclusion: 集成嵌入方法显著提升了LLM缓存系统的性能，减少了计算开销。

Abstract: Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM)
systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once,
and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic
caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,
which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships
present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble
embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained
meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.
We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring
cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our
ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent
queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting
non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble
embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in
distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to
more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in
LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: DCE框架通过频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器解决DIL中的类不平衡和跨域分布偏移问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIL在非平稳环境中面临类内不平衡和跨域分布偏移的挑战，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出DCE框架，包括频率感知专家组和动态专家选择器，分别解决类内不平衡和跨域知识迁移问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，DCE表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCE有效解决了DIL中的关键挑战，为类不平衡和跨域学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现小批量训练语言模型更稳定且高效，提出Adam超参数调整规则，并建议避免梯度累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为小批量训练不稳定，但本研究挑战这一观点，探索小批量（甚至批量大小为1）的潜力。

Method: 提出Adam超参数调整规则，测试小批量训练稳定性及性能。

Result: 小批量训练更稳定、对超参数选择更鲁棒，性能不亚于大批量，且支持纯SGD训练。

Conclusion: 推荐使用小批量训练，避免梯度累积，除非在多设备训练中带宽受限。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model
pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which
trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch
size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,
other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small
batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for
scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch
sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter
choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch
sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,
even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these
results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and
setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient
accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas,
bottlenecked by inter-device bandwidth.

TL;DR: 研究发现，组合泛化能力由数据多样性而非数据规模驱动，线性分解表示结构是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当代视觉模型是否具备组合理解能力，以及数据规模和多样性对组合泛化的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验，系统变化数据规模、概念多样性和组合覆盖率，评估预训练模型（DINO、CLIP）。

Result: 组合泛化依赖数据多样性，线性分解表示结构能实现高效泛化；预训练模型表现高于随机但不完美。

Conclusion: 强调构建多样性数据集和优化表示结构对组合学习的重要性。

Abstract: Compositional understanding is crucial for human intelligence, yet it remains
unclear whether contemporary vision models exhibit it. The dominant machine
learning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes
will improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional
generalization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that
systematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We
find that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere
data scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a
linearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into
additive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling
perfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained
models (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting
partial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on
constructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering
the importance of representational structure that enables efficient
compositional learning. Code available at
