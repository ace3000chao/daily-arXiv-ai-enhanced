First, on a benchmark suite\ncomprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages,\nwe show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are\nsubstantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by\nconventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax\ntree with borders and padding.

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making.

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations.

We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

Finally, we sketch a model of semantics\nunified through words-as-classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u63a5\u5730\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u732e\u56de\u987e\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u63a5\u5730\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u81ea\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c0f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u201c\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u201c\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201c\u8bcd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u63a5\u5730\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning\nmethods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,\npreventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In\ngeneral, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and\nthe locations of relevant information in contexts.

With the increasing\nrelevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,\nparticularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.\nIn this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded\ntopic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.\nA probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over\ntime. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the\npostponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals\nshifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to\nrecent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,\nfinance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,\nincluding preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word\ndistributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for\nanalyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the\nimplications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and\nrefinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\uff08DETM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u653f\u7b56\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u5173\u6ce8\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u5230\u8fd1\u671f\u6ce8\u91cd\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u653f\u7b56\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u7403\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528DETM\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u67901995\u81f32023\u5e74UNFCCC\u653f\u7b56\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "DETM\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\u8f6c\u5411\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u6280\u672f\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u5168\u7403\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DETM\u662f\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u653f\u7b56\u8bdd\u8bed\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u653f\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

In particular, we observe that a major\nsource of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of\nvisual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy\nOptimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages\nthe model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal\nsupervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,\nexternal reward models, or proprietary models.

We also\nobserve a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating\nimproved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis\nof PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze\nand mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss.

We systematically evaluate various\nlinear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced\ngating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this\ncomprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M\nparameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six\nlinear attention variants across five hybridization ratios.

We propose a family of approaches: (1)\n\\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent\npolicies via competitive self-play; (2) \\textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play\n(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and\n(3) the most promising variant, \\textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},\ncreates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of\nNSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a\ncontinuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety\nsimulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car\nTag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and\nheuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy\nquality, \\ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In\nGandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through\nand jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.\nFurthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered\nvulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of\nimproving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more\ncreative and open-ended strategy discovery", "AI": {"tldr": "FMSP\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8d8a\u7b56\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1avFMSP\u3001NSSP\u548cQDSP\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Car Tag\u548cGandalf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFMSP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecvFMSP\u3001NSSP\u548cQDSP\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Car Tag\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728Gandalf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834LLM\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u5e76\u4fee\u8865\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "FMSP\u4e3a\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to\nprovide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair\nstabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates\nseen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer\nreview shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer\nreview with the open-source \\emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a\nconfigurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a\nharmoniser merges their verdicts.

The $\\beta$-VAE framework\nintroduces a hyperparameter $\\beta$ to balance disentanglement and\nreconstruction quality, where setting $\\beta > 1$ introduces an information\nbottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To\naddress this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that\nleverages a range of $\\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent\nrepresentations.

Although\ngeneralization increases computational and data-management complexity, our\ndistributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training\nacross diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five\n5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency\nby ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and\nby >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic\nand achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks,\nrespectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput\nover MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture,\noffer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\uff08RAN\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u548c\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3RAN\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u5f02\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u57285G\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534710%-20%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cGAT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e5d\u5c0f\u533a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAI\u539f\u751f6G RAN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,\nthe injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,\ne.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor\nattack risks in GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "GUI\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982VisualTrap\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u97005%\u6bd2\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aGUI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVisualTrap\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd2\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bef\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u97005%\u6bd2\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9690\u853d\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e0d\u540cGUI\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u4e9f\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Since\ndifferent discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with\nsingle-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that\nidentifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.\nHowever, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among\nmultiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic\nemotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal\nemotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring\nthe heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data\nand label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt\ncross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data.

As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are\ndesigned under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are\ntypically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts\ntheir ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly\nencountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy\nconversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous\nGraph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both\nhomogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among\nsensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -\nwhich exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics.

Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation\nand lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced\nretrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits\ngeneralization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising\nalternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that\noverlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In\nthis work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers\nboth 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using\ndiffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional\ngeneration process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion\nMolecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates\ntopological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,\na transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral\ndependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact\nstructures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through\nsampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,\nSpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the\nchallenge of molecular structure elucidation.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05.

By combining these two techniques\nsynergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems\nof linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.\nThis drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to\nsignificantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as\nthe main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the\nrobustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial\nconditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eN\u7248\u672c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NVML\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u8f6f\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528N\u7248\u672c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408FMEA\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u52a0\u6743\u8f6f\u6295\u7968\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNVML\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728FGSM\u548cPGD\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NVML\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We address these limitations\nthrough two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to\nincorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data\npoint, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views\nwhile scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches\nare theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for\nalignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to\nmulti-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three\nother datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing\nmulti-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.\nWe also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to\nother contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities.
