The Cases of Caste and Religion", "comment": "Accepted to AIES 2025", "summary": "Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been\nmeasured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global\nNorth-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and\ntext generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines."}

Although a preliminary\ninvestigation examined involuntary eye movements and perceived maneuverability\nunder two distinct machine dynamics with preserved SoA, it remains unclear how\nsystematic variations in motion dynamics influence these factors. Therefore,\nthe purpose of the present research was to investigate whether systematic\nvariations in the dynamic properties of a ride-on machine, where the perceived\nmaneuverability is modulated, influence the accuracy of involuntary eye\nmovements in human operators. Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose\ntime constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was\nsystematically manipulated.

Our method introduces a probabilistic\nBernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach\nencompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while\nmaintaining theoretical tractability.

To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context.

While recent research has explored the use of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for detecting such misinformation, practical tools that also\nsupport explanation and correction remain limited. We present MisVisFix, an\ninteractive dashboard that leverages both Claude and GPT models to support the\nfull workflow of detecting, explaining, and correcting misleading\nvisualizations. MisVisFix correctly identifies 96% of visualization issues and\naddresses all 74 known visualization misinformation types, classifying them as\nmajor, minor, or potential concerns. It provides detailed explanations,\nactionable suggestions, and automatically generates corrected charts. An\ninteractive chat interface allows users to ask about specific chart elements or\nrequest modifications. The dashboard adapts to newly emerging misinformation\nstrategies through targeted user interactions. User studies with visualization\nexperts and developers of fact-checking tools show that MisVisFix accurately\nidentifies issues and offers useful suggestions for improvement. By\ntransforming LLM-based detection into an accessible, interactive platform,\nMisVisFix advances visualization literacy and supports more trustworthy data\ncommunication."}

Pure data-driven deep\nlearning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding\nduring training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their\napplicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our\nevaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of\nthe U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications."}

The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual\nangle estimates ranged from 3.9{\\deg} to 9.4{\\deg} for the models evaluated.\nFurthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable\nclinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of\nnormal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for\napplying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle\nestimation.

We discover that graph structures provide more consistent\ncross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,\ntraditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various\ndomains into a unified representation space but often lack structural\ncross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which\nemphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp\nconsists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting\ngraph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend\nonly on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the\ngraph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract\nstructural information and provide discriminative graph representations\ncomparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the\nrepresentations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a\ncomprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and\ngraph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the\ncompetitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in\nhandling graphs without node attributes."}
