This work rejects that premise. It\nproposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric\nconsequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in\nbiological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival\nManifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature\ngeodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A\nsurvival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is\nintroduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric\nflow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective\nand prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of\nsurvival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The\nframework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci\ncurvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.\nHealth, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions\nin the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free\nfoundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging\nmachine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself."}

Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model.

Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis.

However, these models face inherent limitations in handling\nmulti-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.\nWhile recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote\nsensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,\nlacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of\nlanguage. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to\nlanguage-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the\nGlobal Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a\nlanguage-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs\nas the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action\nspaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We\nfirst explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in\nremote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,\nincluding unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and\nreasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global\nworkspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered\nsolutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research\ndirections from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task\nunderstanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and\nautonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for\nthe next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a\nroadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis."}

While existing visualization\ndesign models have provided valuable structure and guidance, they tend to\nforeground technical problem-solving and underemphasize the interpretive,\njudgment-based aspects of design.

These dimensions remain underexplored in\nvisualization research, particularly from the perspective of expert\npractitioners. This paper investigates how visualization designers frame\nproblems and navigate the dynamic interplay between problem understanding and\nsolution development. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 11 expert\npractitioners using design challenges, diary entries, and semi-structured\ninterviews. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified key strategies\nthat participants used to frame problems, reframe them in response to evolving\nconstraints or insights, and build bridges between problem and solution spaces.\nThese included using metaphors, heuristics, sketching, primary generators, and\nreflective evaluation of failed or incomplete ideas.

While MLP-based\nautoencoders (AE) are commonly employed, their dependence on flattening\noperations exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, leading to excessively\nlarge model sizes, high computational overhead, and challenging optimization\nfor deep structural feature capture. Although existing tensor networks\nalleviate computational burdens through tensor decomposition techniques, most\nexhibit limited capability in learning non-linear relationships. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce the Mode-Aware Non-linear Tucker Autoencoder\n(MA-NTAE). MA-NTAE generalized classical Tucker decomposition to a non-linear\nframework and employs a Pick-and-Unfold strategy, facilitating flexible\nper-mode encoding of high-order tensors via recursive unfold-encode-fold\noperations, effectively integrating tensor structural priors. Notably, MA-NTAE\nexhibits linear growth in computational complexity with tensor order and\nproportional growth with mode dimensions.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across\nuniversal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark\ndatasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\\% accuracy, even enabling it\nto outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM\nalone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,\nhighlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post\ninteraction features."}

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL.

However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect\nto the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured\nTransformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation\nsettings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in\nbracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained\non large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating\nbasic model properties."}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework, FairDRL-ST, based on disentangled representation learning, to\naddress fairness concerns in spatio-temporal prediction, with a particular\nfocus on mobility demand forecasting. By leveraging adversarial learning and\ndisentangled representation learning, our framework learns to separate\nattributes that contain sensitive information.

NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,\nwhich are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and\nnewly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding\nmeteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make\nspatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To\nhandle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,\nstructure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural\ninformation loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To\nsolve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node\ndegrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and\nobservations.

In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal.

We then examine\ncounterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically\nlarge amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all\nalgorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to\nmitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for\noffline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs,\nbut they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to\nsearch for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied."}

We first\nevaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random\nForest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple\ndataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong\nperformance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline.\nIn addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and\ntopological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building\non these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which\ncombines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model\nshows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results\nhighlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of\ngraph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection."}

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training.

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task.

We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path.

Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to\ngenerate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan.

We show that\nmost detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student\ncontribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are\nparticularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in\neducational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'\nlives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly\navailable at\nhttps://github.com/lukasgehring/Assessing-LLM-Text-Detection-in-Educational-Contexts."}

However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,\ninconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit\ndesign objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we\npropose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for\ncircuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design\nresearch papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +\nAct (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step\ninformation retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,\ncapable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses\ngrounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing\nof both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive\nanalysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,\nautomated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.\nUnlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM\ndecouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over\narbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard\nLLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining\nthe same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,\novercoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To\nevaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval\nand citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep\nreasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%\naccuracy on Reas-100."}

Estimating Reliability in Uncertainty-Aware Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect\ncontent, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or\nagentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we\ninvestigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether\nLLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability\nestimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of\ninternal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and\naggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level\nreliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,\nwe find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and\nmodel confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect\nresponses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our\nprobing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the\ndetection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results\nunderscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the\npotential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation."}

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they\noffer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when\ntasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow\nmulti-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise\nrequire deeper architectures."}

This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist\nmultimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates\nits zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based\nquestion answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified\nprotocol.

On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and\nunderstanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and\nsurpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in\nunderstanding.
