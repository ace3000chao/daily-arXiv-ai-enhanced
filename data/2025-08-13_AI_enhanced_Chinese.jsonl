We choose council debate\nas our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.\nAlthough our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific\nclaims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it\nranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u672f\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u6216\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u63d0\u53ca\u3002\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u672f\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\u79d1\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5355\u8fa9\u8bba\u3001\u56e2\u961f\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u5f20\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u4f53\u63d0\u53ca\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

In this work, we present an approach for\nimplementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that\nautomatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them\nin various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a\nspecific story that the article is covering.

We\npresent an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in\nreal time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the\nproposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and online topic modeling methods.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations.

However, many\ndeep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate\non a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and\nrestricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training\nlibraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of\na physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model\nlearns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces\nthe conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of\nthe HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant\nconditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the\nencoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop\naugmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a\npredefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically\nconsistent inverse mappings.

In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises\nsimulated datasets of various {\\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of\ndifferent analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare\nthe state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing\napproach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)\nspectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are\ndeformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;\nand (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A\nlarge dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an\nexperimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple\nradionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,\nthe statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning\napproaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the\nperformance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when\nspectral signatures are not modeled correctly.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated\nIslamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of\nthought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks\nthe distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate\nabstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on\ntheir ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention\nexperiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal\nschools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,\nGemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for\nminimizing confident incorrect answers.

Due to this strict\nrequirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve\ncompetitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine\n(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict.

To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in\nTelugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600\nderivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.\n  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates\npositively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such\nas Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.\nHowever, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.\nUnigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance\nthan morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others\nacross most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological\nsegmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In\ncontrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\\'enyi entropy\nshowed no correlation with downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BPE\u4e0eUnigram\uff09\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u6cf0\u5362\u56fa\u8bed\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u53e5\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Unigram\uff09\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u3002"}}

In recent years, researchers have made\nsignificant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for\nspatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,\ni.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,\nleading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies\nhave introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically\nfocus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),\nthereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban\nphenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network\nwith Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal\nprediction.

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions.

This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups.

Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

While\nthis design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load\ninterference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise\nprogram synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison\nbetween a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that\nthe latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having\ntool-calling capabilities.

We evaluate MiGrATe on three\nchallenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program\ninduction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it\nconsistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating\nthe potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without\nexternal supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiGrATe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GRPO\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u4f18\u5316LLMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u8d2a\u5a6a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u91c7\u6837\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u6574LLMs\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8bcd\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u548cARC\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5f52\u7eb3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u63a8\u7406\u548cTTT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MiGrATe\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7ebfTTT\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u590d\u6742\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected\nRAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,\nthus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of\nsemantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant\nknowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of\nanonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two\nkey challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted\ninto retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous\nentities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric\nabstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies.

It supplements meaningful\nsemantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),\nthe second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into\nstructured abstract concept paths.

Our results\ndemonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal\nrouting is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically\ngrounded without sacrificing general performance much.

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up\nto 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within\n1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant\nacceleration without compromising generation quality.

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities.

Chi-Geometry generates\nsynthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological\ntraits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions\nand species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains\nexactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are\nlabeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a\ncohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict\nchirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable\nand less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the\ngraph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved\npredictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to\ngenerate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nGNN architectures.

A recent line of work mitigates this by using\nsymbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry\nsolver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards.

Moreover, most existing\napproaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be\nequally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel\nmask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to\nenhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a\ntwo-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask\nretention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.\nExtensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration\nperformance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and\neffective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5MaC-Cal\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u6b20\u81ea\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMaC-Cal\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MaC-Cal\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively.
