A Comparative Study of AR See-Through vs. 2D Minimap", "comment": null, "summary": "In high-stakes, time-critical scenarios-such as emergency evacuation, first\nresponder prioritization, and crisis management -- decision-makers must rapidly\nchoose among spatial targets, such as exits, individuals to assist, or areas to\nsecure. Advances in indoor sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) can support\nthese decisions by visualizing real-time situational data and AI suggestions on\n2D maps. However, mentally mapping this information onto real-world spaces\nimposes significant cognitive load. This load can impair users' ability to\nappropriately judge AI suggestions, leading to inappropriate reliance (e.g.,\naccepting wrong AI suggestions or rejecting correct ones). Embedded\nvisualizations in Augmented Reality (AR), by directly overlaying information\nonto physical environments, may reduce this load and foster more deliberate,\nappropriate reliance on AI. But is this true? In this work, we conducted an\nempirical study (N = 32) comparing AR see-through (embedded visualization) and\n2D Minimap in time-critical, AI-assisted spatial target selection tasks.\nContrary to our expectations, users exhibited greater inappropriate reliance on\nAI in the AR condition. Our analysis further reveals that this is primarily due\nto over-reliance, with factors specific to embedded visualizations, such as\nperceptual challenges, visual proximity illusions, and highly realistic visual\nrepresentations.

This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might\nbe crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms\nanalogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to\nimprove an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen\nchanges.

Model editing methods have emerged as\nefficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge\nmodification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.\nIn parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge\nremains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how\ndifferent fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing\ntechniques.

Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data.

Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores).

The dataset\nincluded behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.\nExperiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream\ncombinations.

Results: The CM outperformed both RF and\nLinear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985\nvs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356).

To enable the agile creation of EventBoxes in Sequen-C, we\nhave added user-driven transformations, including alignment, sorting,\nsubstitution and aggregation. To enhance analytical depth, we incorporate\nautomatically generated statistical analyses, providing additional insight into\nthe significance of attribute interactions. We evaluated our approach involving\n21 participants (3 domain experts, 18 novice data analysts). We used the ICE-T\nframework to assess visualization value, user performance metrics completing a\nseries of tasks, and interactive sessions with domain experts. We also present\nthree case studies with real-world healthcare data demonstrating how EventBox\nand its integration into Sequen-C reveal meaningful patterns, anomalies, and\ninsights.

This paper\nintroduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of\nfairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to\noutcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated\nAI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset\nand on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our\nanalysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with\nclassifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin,\ndespite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that\nrepresentativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as\na dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes\nthis shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across\nsubpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External\nTransportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness\ngeneralization.

A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score\nfunctions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low\nscores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these\nmethods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their\nefficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased\ndistribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These\nextreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores\nto ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies.

Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but\ndeep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection\noverhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also\nincorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a\ncredibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring\nrobust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the\nproposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead\nby 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving\nnear-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to\ntraditional softmax based DL models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u5f15\u64ce\uff08BAE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528SHAP\u548cDkNN\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5229\u7528SHAP\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u540d\u548cDkNN\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u51cf\u5c1170%\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u300162%\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u53478.5\u500d\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e6G\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are\naggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to\nshare knowledge among clients.

As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of\ngradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient\nfluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second,\nthe direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can\nincur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient\nMatching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient\nmatching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data\nand apply independent training at the meta-learner.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of\na regression model learned from the ground truth story points.

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

To support reliable\nprediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables\nhave been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades.\nWith the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple\ninitiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more\naccurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate\nmodeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack\ninterpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed\nmostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid\napproaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial\n\"low-fidelity\" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using\nML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube\ngeometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in\nthermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML\nmodels to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code.\nThree empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as\nbase models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577\nexperimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and\nMortimore.

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset\ndemonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection\nF1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and\ntrustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of\nagentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInsightX Agent\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLMM\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u65e0\u635f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SDMSD\u548cEGR\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684X\u5c04\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "InsightX Agent\u4ee5LMM\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u534f\u8c03SDMSD\u548cEGR\u5de5\u5177\uff0cSDMSD\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f3a\u9677\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u6848\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7NMS\u4f18\u5316\uff0cEGR\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728GDXray+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cInsightX Agent\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe96.35%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "InsightX Agent\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLMM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often\nsuffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to\nhigh data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent\nresearch has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.\nHowever, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches\nthat require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time\nsettings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability\nto adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the\nrisk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live\nsystems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework\nfor incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack\ndetection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by\nincrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The\nframework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects\ntransitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions\nacross sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:\nLeverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal\nstructures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:\nEmploys Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the\nlearned causal graphs.

An Analysis of Simple Test-Time Scaling", "comment": null, "summary": "Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this\nscaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually\ncontrolling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum\nlength or scaling up by iteratively appending \"Wait\" when the model is about to\nterminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the\ntest-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,\nit is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to\nunlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --\nrather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u52a0\u201cWait\u201d\u8fdb\u884c\u653e\u5927\u5219\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002o1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u653e\u5927\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f29\u653e\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8ffd\u52a0\u201cWait\u201d\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800c\u8ffd\u52a0\u201cWait\u201d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u632f\u8361\uff1bo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u653e\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800co1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7f29\u653e\u80fd\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u590d\u5236\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

To make structured predictions for node\nlabels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for\nStructured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node\nlabels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through\nthe variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to\nDPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained\ndiffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's\nM-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly\ncompetitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation,\nand diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of\nvarying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on\nwhich previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational\nconstraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured\nnode classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReDiSC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u56fe\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002ReDiSC\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ReDiSC\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206EM\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728E\u6b65\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eGNN\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u660e\u786e\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "ReDiSC\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "ReDiSC\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Using natural language processing and large-scale\nstatistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive\nlanguage vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and\ninstitutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and\nsigned reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer\nidentity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden\nbiases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about\nanonymity's role in fairness.

This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable\ncapabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a\nfundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from\ncomparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have\nincreasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality\nto children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)\nshowed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and\nlinguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could\nacquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success\nreflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would\nshow consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's\nexperiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech\ntranscription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over\n500 hours of video data spread across all three children.

To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence\n(CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different\noral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert\nclinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to\nemulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic\naids.\n  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a\nspecialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical\nDiagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the\nsystematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates\nin two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that\nleverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.\n  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310\nimages, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final\nvalidation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training\ndata to over 30,000 image-text pairs.

When\ntreatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be\nestimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized\nsettings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and\napproximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common\nchallenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly\nlabeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To\naddress this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for\nidentifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones,\nusing only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach\nusing both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with\ndiverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various\nscenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow\nestimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal\nsowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show\nthat PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from\nunlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control\ngroup, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value.

Companion code and\n  reproducibility materials available", "summary": "The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such\nas Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational\nprinciple: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how\ninformation flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph.

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for\ndecision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based\ngenerative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the\noffline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return\nestimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model.\nSuch retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and\nimproves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or\nout-of-distribution states.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation.

To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience.

State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly\nabove chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth\nMA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates\nsuggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily\nsimulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by\nprobing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models\nevaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with\nrandomly placed components.

While explicitly incorporating commonsense\nknowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps\ndistinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing\ncontradictory and neutral inferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff08NLI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e38\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u63d0-\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u751f\u6210\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9NLI\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8574\u542b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u4e2d\u7acb\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728NLI\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address\nthis, we propose a novel framework that incorporates model multiplicity into\nexplanation generation by aggregating partial dependence profiles (PDP) from a\nset of near optimal models, known as the Rashomon set. The resulting Rashomon\nPDP captures interpretive variability and highlights areas of disagreement,\nproviding users with a richer, uncertainty aware view of feature effects. To\nevaluate its usefulness, we introduce two quantitative metrics, the coverage\nrate and the mean width of confidence intervals, to evaluate the consistency\nbetween the standard PDP and the proposed Rashomon PDP.

In this paper, we study whether\nmemorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the\nprivacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we\nre-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely\nrecollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed\ncontextual memorization.\n  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual\nmemorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning\nability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its\nrecollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a\nlearned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training.\nConceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based\nmemorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization.\nTheoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization,\nbut imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and\ninformation requirements.\n  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of\ndifferent entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on\nmemorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a\nlanguage cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c)\nimproved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but\nincreases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing\nreports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat\nnor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u5938\u5927\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u907f\u514d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5728LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5938\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u572818\u79cdLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u907f\u514d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5fc6\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5fc6\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u53ef\u80fd\u5938\u5927\u9690\u79c1\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

These smooth transformations can be viewed as\ncontinuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence\nrelations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network\narchitectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and\nhave provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample\nefficiency.

In this work, we extend\nequivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie\nsubgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.\nWe begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:\ntheir hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for\nmoving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and\ndemonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant\ncounterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity\ngeneralization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification.

For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA\nremained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they\nwere allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented\nwith the options among which they had to select.

This study presents a theoretical and empirical\ninvestigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.\nFirst, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the\nbase model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial\nprobability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may\nrestrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases\ntoken-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,\nanswer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain\npaths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers.

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities\ngeneralize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address\nthis, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs'\nability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can\nbe solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317\nproblems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which\nwe curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents\none algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but\nalgorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs\nstruggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving\nonly 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose\nattempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem\nsimilarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy\nimprovement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code\nembedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While\nthe adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than\nrandom, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative\nelements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized\nmethod, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.

Moving beyond flat,\nfixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences,\ngrids, relations, and multimodality.

For tracking action\ncoreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms\nother reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points.

Several deep learning-based models have been developed to\nidentify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,\nbut also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.\nHowever, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness\nrequirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input\nsequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model\nunderstanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the\nmodel can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To\nachieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,\ncalled ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection\nmodel), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to\ndetect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder\nblock to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to\ncapture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the\ntransformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post\nembeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence\nembedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to\nenrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked\nattackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for\nsequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information\n(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors\nof bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.\nExtensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can\neffectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aROBAD\u7684\u65b0\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ROBAD\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6355\u6349\u5e16\u5b50\u7ea7\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Yelp\u548cWikipedia\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cROBAD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "ROBAD\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Machine learning methods can\nprovide highly accurate electricity price forecasts, critical for informing the\ndecisions of market participants.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating probabilistic\nforecasts from ensembles of point forecasts, called Isotonic Quantile\nRegression Averaging (iQRA). Building on the established framework of Quantile\nRegression Averaging (QRA), we introduce stochastic order constraints to\nimprove forecast accuracy, reliability, and computational costs. In an\nextensive forecasting study of the German day-ahead electricity market, we show\nthat iQRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art postprocessing methods in\nterms of both reliability and sharpness.

In particular,\nresearchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative\nAI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the\nfull potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires\naccess to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the\nanalog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not\nonly confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial\nsemiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely\nconfined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused\nprivate datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation\nand impedes progress across the research community. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology\ndiscovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or\ninstitutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this\nvision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique\nchallenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development\nand data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure\nboth flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor\nmanufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset\nsizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized\nbaselines--while maintaining strict data privacy.

Our theory shows that exploiting\ncross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD\ndemonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and\nefficiency.

Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a\ngiven term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of\nmany, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes\nin diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship\ndedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that\ntradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community\nby demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance\ntesting perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under\nmild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the\n$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical\nsignificance.

To address this\nresearch gap, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, we conduct a\npilot study with 20 crowd-workers on Amazon MTurk to experimentally validate\nthe alignment of existing CF evaluation metrics with real-world user\npreferences. Results show that user-preferred CFEs matched those based on\nproximity in only 63.81% of cases, highlighting the limited applicability of\nthese metrics in real-world settings. Second, inspired by the need to design a\nuser-informed evaluation metric for CFEs, we conduct a more detailed two-day\nuser study with 41 participants facing realistic credit application scenarios\nto find experimental support for or against three intuitive hypotheses that may\nexplain how end users evaluate CFEs. Third, based on the findings of this\nsecond study, we propose the AWP model, a novel user-centric, two-stage model\nthat describes one possible mechanism by which users evaluate and select CFEs.\nOur results show that AWP predicts user-preferred CFEs with 84.37% accuracy.\nOur study provides the first human-centered validation for personalized cost\nmodels in CFE generation and highlights the need for adaptive, user-centered\nevaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08CFEs\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578bAWP\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597dCFEs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe84.37%\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709CFEs\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff1a1\uff0920\u540d\u4f17\u5305\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff1b2\uff0941\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAWP\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684CFEs\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4ec563.81%\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bAWP\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597dCFEs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe84.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5728CFE\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for\naccessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We\npropose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of\nintelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research\ntasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an\nessential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems\nadopt an \"input-wait-output\" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive\nresults after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade\neffects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during\ninvestigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the\nhuman role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement\nwhere humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at\ncritical junctures.

GNNs have proven\nhighly effective in various network-based learning applications and require\nsome form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily\ninfluenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node\nfeatures are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of\ninherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal\nperformance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for\nconstructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average\ncontrollability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as\nnode-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building\non this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average\ncontrollability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional\nfeature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive\nnumerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network\ndatasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results\ndemonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space\nsignificantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding\nmethod outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC\nfrom 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset,\nunderscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node\nrepresentations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6392\u540d\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347GNN\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5e38\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u6216\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86GNN\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7b49\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u6392\u540d\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u56fe\u8bba\u6307\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GNN\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6392\u540d\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfone-hot\u7f16\u7801\uff08ROC AUC\u4ece68.7%\u63d0\u5347\u81f373.9%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347GNN\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds\na state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to\noptimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID\nfocuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline\napplications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent\ndata (filtering) or all available data (smoothing).

First, we show that the presence of a\nsecondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal\nKalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent\nstate-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank\nregression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update\nstep from data.

However, traditional evaluation methods, which\nfocus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the\nlearning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of\nActive Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that\ncharacterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,\ncoverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and\nself-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes\neffectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting\nfull learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals\ncrucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the\nscalability of AL methods.

However, existing methods like\nGeographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on\nunavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal\nstrengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space\nGridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and\ngridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG\nuses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel\nAngle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous\nchannel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder\n(CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse\ncodebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized\nStatistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training\nscheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous\n(PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by\nsystematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm.\nEvaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and\nclustering quality on synthetic data.

In RLHF for\nLMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of\nresponses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward\nmodel (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward\ngiven by the RM.

When planning patient admissions,\npredictions on their length-of-stay (LOS) made by machine learning (ML) models\nare used to ensure bed availability. However, the actual LOS for each patient\nmay differ considerably from the predicted value, potentially making the\nschedule infeasible.

The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to\nempower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous\ndriving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis.

This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored\nto scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device\nheterogeneity.

Results show the model achieves a strong\npredictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet.\nCritically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the\nrequired wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly\n3.5 times over the traditional solver.

To address this, we propose a\nWasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM),\ntraining specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization\nand residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for\nCategory 2.

Our adaptive\nfusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific\nperformance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further\nguides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model\nrepresentations, enabling more principled integration of complementary\nfeatures.\n  Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across\ncategories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2),\noutperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches.

Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel\nand reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model\narchitecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to\ntransmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in\nevery global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial\nmodels for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage\nefficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an\nauxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a\nsingle model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients\nfrom the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server.\nAdditionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in\nselected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We\nprovide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its\nconvergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results\nfurther indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction\nover existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCSE-FSL\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u8054\u90a6\u5206\u88c2\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5206\u88c2\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FSL\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CSE-FSL\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ec5\u7ef4\u62a4\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSE-FSL\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "CSE-FSL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5206\u88c2\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
