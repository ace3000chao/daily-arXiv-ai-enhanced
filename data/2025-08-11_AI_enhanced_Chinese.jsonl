The architecture\nimplements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active\nInference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through\nhierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring\nsafety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in\nnatural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy\nminimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures.\nThe paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our\nframework's safety properties.

In this work, developed in\ncollaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework\nthat reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating\nheterogeneous data.

When jointly\nleveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent\nreconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data\nquality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware\ninference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect\ninputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for\noperator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled\nwith hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational\nconstraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology\nrequirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components\nensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,\nenabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under\nreal-world deployment conditions.

To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly.

Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by\ninvestigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,\ncurating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,\nthese methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to\nprobe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally\nexpensive and time-consuming.

Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived\ndatasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict\nLLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find\nthat sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to\npredict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the\nfactual landscape.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by\nretrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM\nreasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the\nrelational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable\nperformance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)\nmethods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,\nintroducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world\nqueries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for\naccurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required\nstructures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we\npropose a \\textbf{\\underline{Logic}}-aware\n\\textbf{\\underline{R}}etrieval-\\textbf{\\underline{A}}ugmented\n\\textbf{\\underline{G}}eneration framework (\\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically\nextracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval\nwithout any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query\ninto a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to\nmodel the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step\nreasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that\nsubproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order.

However, excessively long reasoning traces introduce substantial\nchallenges in terms of training cost, inference latency, and deployment\nfeasibility. While various CoT compression approaches have emerged to address\nthis challenge, they face inherent trade-offs: token-level methods often\ndisrupt syntactic and logical coherence, while step-level methods based on\nperplexity fail to reliably capture the logically critical reasoning steps. In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric. Finally, ASAP teaches models to autonomously generate and\nleverage these concise CoTs at inference time, enabling efficient reasoning in\ncoding tasks.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as\ntwo phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies).

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters.

Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties.

As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges.

In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,\nunstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic\nforgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities.

Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in\nsmall-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new\ncontent and retaining existing capabilities.

To be specific,\nDynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based\non their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it\ntrains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from\n$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference.

Empirical results\ndemonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains\ncompatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques.

To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a\ncase study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.\nThis choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide\nemotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset.

Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts.

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of\nvarying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task. Results,\ncompared against naive fine-tuning, demonstrate CLs effectiveness in mitigating\nforgetting, making it a promising approach for scalable ASR in diverse Indian\nlanguages under realistic constraints.

A key algorithmic tool in neuromorphic\ncomputing is spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are biologically inspired\nneural networks which utilize stateful neurons, and provide low-bit data\nprocessing by encoding and decoding information using spikes. Similar to SNNs,\ndeep state-space models (SSMs) utilize stateful building blocks. However, deep\nSSMs, which recently achieved competitive performance in various temporal\nmodeling tasks, are typically designed with high-precision activation functions\nand no reset mechanisms. To bridge the gains offered by SNNs and the recent\ndeep SSM models, we propose a novel multiple-output spiking neuron model that\ncombines a linear, general SSM state transition with a non-linear feedback\nmechanism through reset. Compared to the existing neuron models for SNNs, our\nproposed model clearly conceptualizes the differences between the spiking\nfunction, the reset condition and the reset action. The experimental results on\nvarious tasks, i.e., a keyword spotting task, an event-based vision task and a\nsequential pattern recognition task, show that our proposed model achieves\nperformance comparable to existing benchmarks in the SNN literature.

Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs.

While previous multimodal\nresearch has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the\nsense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception.

In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property\nestablishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\\mu$:\nlower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but\nimpose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in\nthem. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve\neffective classification performance under label noise.

The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception.

Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models.
