Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1是一个新的强化学习框架，通过分解人类行为模拟任务为两个阶段（理由生成和动作预测），并结合自监督和分层奖励结构，显著提升了LLM在在线购物环境中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于LLM生成的理性数据，但其性能受限于模型的推理能力，因此需要一种新方法来增强LLM的推理能力以模拟真实人类行为。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和动作预测两个阶段，分别使用自监督信号和分层奖励结构进行指导。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线有超过65%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过创新的强化学习框架，显著提升了LLM在模拟人类行为中的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DG-PRM提出了一种动态且可泛化的过程奖励建模方法，通过奖励树和多维标准提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，泛化能力不足，且静态评估标准难以适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度标准，动态选择奖励信号，并引入帕累托优势估计处理多维信号。

Result: 实验显示DG-PRM在基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM为复杂任务提供了高效且泛化的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

### [3] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriMinder是一个交互式系统，用于检测和减轻自然语言数据库查询中的认知偏差，通过语义映射、分析框架和优化的LLM系统提升分析质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言数据库接口的普及，缺乏统计背景的用户可能提出带有偏差的分析问题，这一问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: VeriMinder采用三种创新方法：上下文语义映射框架、基于Hard-to-Vary原则的分析框架，以及优化的LLM提示生成系统。

Result: 用户测试显示，82.5%的参与者认为系统提升了分析质量；在比较评估中，VeriMinder在具体性、全面性和准确性上至少优于其他方法20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder能有效帮助用户避免分析中的“错误问题”漏洞，其开源代码和提示库可供进一步研究和社区采用。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效端到端的自动口语评估方法，用于多部分第二语言测试，显著减少了推理时间和模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自动口语评估系统需要转录和多个部分模型的问题，提高效率和实用性。

Method: 使用单一Whisper-small编码器处理所有四个口语回答，通过轻量级聚合器结合信息并预测最终分数。

Result: 系统RMSE为0.384，优于文本基线（0.44），且仅需168M参数（Whisper-small的70%）。数据采样策略使模型仅需44.8%的语料库即可达到0.383 RMSE。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和性能上均有显著提升，适用于大规模计算机辅助语言学习系统。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [5] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了六种AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，发现不同工具在对抗攻击下的表现差异显著，其中人类化攻击效果最明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补文献中关于DeepSeek这一新发布的大语言模型在AI检测领域的空白，评估检测工具在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用六种AI检测工具测试DeepSeek生成的文本，并应用标准和人化改写等对抗攻击，同时探索DeepSeek作为检测器的潜力。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始和改写文本上表现优异，而人类化攻击显著降低了检测准确率。DeepSeek作为检测器表现出高准确率。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击尤其是人类化攻击显著影响检测工具性能，而DeepSeek作为检测器具有潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，更大、更强大的预训练语言模型在上下文证据中更符合贝叶斯定理更新信念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能在上下文中更一致地根据贝叶斯定理更新信念，以理解其能力与规模的关系。

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致性系数（BCC）指标，生成数据集，并在多个预训练语言模型中测量BCC。

Result: 更大、更强大的模型在贝叶斯一致性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果对理解和管理大型语言模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

### [9] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB框架通过非线性门控检索模块高效编辑LLM中的知识，同时保持模型通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有线性Locate-and-Edit方法在编辑大规模事实时可能损害LLM通用能力的问题。

Method: 将编辑事实表示为神经KV数据库，并引入非线性门控检索模块，仅在推理涉及编辑事实时激活。

Result: 在10,000和100,000事实编辑任务中，NeuralDB在编辑效果和通用能力保持上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDB是一种高效、可扩展的LLM知识编辑框架，适用于大规模事实更新。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [10] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键输入标记并调整隐藏激活，无需微调即可优化语言和视觉语言模型的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时引导方法依赖固定干预向量，忽视输入标记的因果影响和梯度信息，尤其在多模态任务中表现不足。

Method: GrAInS利用对比梯度归因识别关键标记，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活，保持表示规模。

Result: GrAInS在TruthfulQA上提升13.22%准确率，在MMHal-Bench上减少幻觉率，SPA-VL对齐胜率提高8.11%。

Conclusion: GrAInS提供细粒度、可解释的模型行为控制，优于微调和现有引导方法，且保持模型流畅性和通用能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，减少人工标注需求，解决语音领域的数据挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统短语断句预测方法依赖大量人工标注，成本高且数据一致性难以保证，LLM在NLP中的成功应用为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 通过LLM生成合成短语断句标注，并与传统标注方法进行比较，评估其在多语言中的有效性。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据能有效缓解短语断句预测中的数据挑战，展现了LLM在语音领域的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM为语音领域提供了一种可行的解决方案，能够减少人工标注需求并提高数据质量。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Motivation: 合成数据在数据驱动应用中具有潜力，但其多样性和隐私风险尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一套评估合成数据多样性和隐私的指标，并通过实验验证了LLM生成数据的局限性，随后提出了一种基于提示的改进方法。

Result: 实验显示LLM生成的合成数据在多样性和隐私保护方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 通过基于提示的方法可以改进合成数据的多样性，同时保护用户隐私。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TELEVAL是一个动态基准测试，专门用于评估口语模型（SLMs）在真实中文交互场景中作为对话代理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注SLMs是否能完成复杂任务，而忽略了用户自然交互的真实场景。

Method: TELEVAL定义了三个评估维度：显式语义、副语言和隐式语义以及系统能力，采用对话格式并分别评估文本和音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，现有SLMs在自然对话任务中仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL可作为以用户为中心的评估框架，促进对话导向SLMs的发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

*Haomin Qi,Zihan Dai,Chengbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态结合BOFT正交稳定性和LoRA-GA梯度对齐快速收敛的混合参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，显著提升了收敛效率和泛化能力，同时降低了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLMs）的规模和内存需求，其微调仍存在计算瓶颈。本文旨在通过参数高效微调技术解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种混合策略，动态结合BOFT和LoRA-GA的优势，并首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLMs，通过结构化酉约束增强梯度稳定性。

Result: 在四个基准测试（GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench、HumanEval）上，混合方法在7B到405B参数的模型中表现优于基线，接近全微调精度，同时减少训练时间2.1倍和内存使用50%。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限环境下LLMs的实际部署提供了实用且可扩展的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 2024年新版GloVe模型通过更新训练数据和改进文档，提升了词嵌入的现代性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014年的GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但语言和世界在变化，且原模型缺乏详细文档，因此需要更新。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练两组词嵌入，并通过词汇比较、直接测试和NER任务评估。

Result: 2024版模型包含新文化词汇，结构任务表现相当，且在非西方新闻数据等时间依赖任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: 新版GloVe模型更适应当代语言需求，性能提升且文档更完善。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一种新型的端到端口语语言模型，通过双模态头部架构和模块化训练策略，实现了对语言内容、副语言和说话者特征的综合建模，显著提升了口语交互的自然性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语语言模型通常仅关注语言内容，忽略了副语言和说话者特征（如方言、年龄、情感等），限制了模型的自然交互能力。

Method: 采用双模态头部架构分离语言建模和声学实现，提出模块化分阶段训练策略，逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL基准测试中，GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，尤其在情感、方言和年龄敏感交互方面优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应和社交意识的口语系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的表现，重点关注代码生成和编辑能力，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍远落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而忽视了MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE），并利用涵盖五种数学图形的数据集进行测试。

Result: 实验涉及九种主流MLLMs，结果显示现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs在多模态数学推理中的代码能力提供了首次评估，揭示了其当前局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在HIV管理中的能力，开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，并发现Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但复杂问题下性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理的复杂性使其成为LLM应用的理想场景，但临床整合面临准确性、潜在危害和接受度等问题，相关研究较少。

Method: 研究创建了HIVMedQA基准测试，评估了10个LLM（7个通用和3个医学专用），结合词相似性和LLM作为评判的方法。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最优，但复杂问题性能下降；医学微调模型未必优于通用模型，推理和理解是主要挑战。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估，以确保LLM在临床中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer文本嵌入模型中的'粘性令牌'问题，提出了一种检测方法STD，并分析了其对下游任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer文本嵌入模型在NLP任务中广泛应用，但'粘性令牌'会破坏嵌入的可靠性，影响性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于句子和令牌过滤的高效检测方法STD，并应用于40个模型检查点。

Result: 发现了868个粘性令牌，这些令牌通常来自特殊词汇或未使用的条目，且对下游任务性能影响显著（下降高达50%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了粘性令牌的问题，呼吁改进令牌化策略和模型设计以减少其影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过消除选项位置偏见和语义邻近干扰，提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多选题任务中可能利用选项位置或标签的偏见而非真实理解来获得高分，需要一种方法来测量和减少这种偏见。

Method: SCOPE通过重复调用无语义内容的空提示估计模型的偏见分布，并重新分配答案位置以消除偏见，同时避免语义相近的干扰项相邻。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE在性能稳定性和置信度分布上优于现有去偏见方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提升大语言模型评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Conclusion: 知识管理系统可以通过SECI模型和PDCA循环与现有业务流程无缝集成，从而提升组织的效率和战略一致性。

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG依赖外部知识库可能被攻击者注入有害文档，导致误导性输出，需防御方法。

Method: GMTP利用检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，通过掩码语言模型检测低概率令牌以过滤恶意文档。

Result: 实验显示GMTP能过滤90%以上有害内容，同时保留相关文档，保持系统性能。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种高效防御方法，能显著提升RAG系统的安全性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令微调提升了大语言模型（LLM）遵循用户指令的能力，但也增加了对用户输入的依赖，可能导致错误信息的接受和幻觉生成。研究发现指令微调显著增加了LLM对错误信息的接受度，并探讨了其他影响因素。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令微调对LLM接受错误信息的直接影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较指令微调模型和基础模型，分析其对用户提供信息的依赖程度，并探讨其他影响因素。

Result: 指令微调显著增加了LLM对错误信息的接受度，且用户角色、提示结构和警告等因素影响其易感性。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法减少指令微调的负面影响，提升LLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 层剪枝会导致隐藏状态幅度差距，引发性能下降，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp，通过离线重缩放剩余权重补偿幅度差距，无需训练。

Result: 剪枝5层LLaMA-3-8B时，困惑度减半，保留93.19%问答性能，优于基线4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp有效提升层剪枝性能，是一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效定位术语并提升翻译成功率，同时保持通用翻译性能。

Conclusion: Locate-and-Focus方法显著改善了术语翻译效果，为直接语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Method: 比较六种OCR引擎（包括商业和开源系统）在Sinhala和Tamil上的性能，使用五种测量技术评估字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上表现最佳（WER 2.61%），Document AI在Tamil上表现最优（CER 0.78%）。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的OCR性能提供了基准，并引入了一个新的合成Tamil OCR数据集。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Motivation: 企业沟通中需要LLMs适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库难以实现这一目标。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器在基础模型上训练多样化的非结构化风格语料库，然后与指令遵循模型合并。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集和模型上提高了风格一致性，同时保持指令遵循能力，人类评估确认了品牌特定惯例的采纳。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs的风格个性化提供了一种高效路径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Result: 实验证明该方法能可靠地触发可控的推理冗长度增加，且不影响最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该攻击方法作为一种纯资源消耗向量，具有隐蔽性和有效性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Method: 通过ROC、PR和DET曲线分析，比较了LLMs和微调模型在Twitter和Reddit数据集上的表现。

Result: LLMs表现出高假阴性率和系统性低估道德内容，微调模型在道德推理任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 任务特定的微调在道德推理应用中优于提示工程。

Abstract: Moral foundation detection is crucial for analyzing social discourse and
developing ethically-aligned AI systems. While large language models excel
across diverse tasks, their performance on specialized moral reasoning remains
unclear.
  This study provides the first comprehensive comparison between
state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned transformers across Twitter and Reddit

  Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false
negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt
engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning
remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，通过解耦多任务数据集中的示例并利用LLM的细粒度反馈来提升ICL的示例检索质量，实验表明其在30个NLP任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果高度依赖示例质量，但现有方法在跨任务数据分布区分和细粒度反馈利用上存在不足。

Method: TDR框架解耦多任务数据集中的示例，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈指导检索模块训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验显示，TDR显著提升性能并达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松结合不同LLM提升ICL示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合人类专家与大语言模型（LLM）的新框架，以提高社交媒体上宣传检测的标注一致性和可扩展性。通过分层分类法和LLM辅助预标注流程，显著提升了标注效率与一致性，并利用知识蒸馏训练小模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的宣传检测任务复杂且高质量标注数据有限，导致标注一致性低。

Method: 提出分层分类法组织14种宣传技术，采用LLM辅助预标注流程生成标注和解释，并通过知识蒸馏训练小模型。

Result: LLM辅助显著提升了标注一致性和时间效率，小模型通过LLM生成的高质量数据训练表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了支持，符合SDG 16的目标，代码已开源。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR是一个用于LLM错误分析的交互式开源工具，通过生成实例反馈和系统级错误问题，帮助用户深入理解模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常仅提供单一评分或排名，缺乏具体、可操作的性能分析依据。

Method: CLEAR生成实例反馈，识别系统级错误问题，并通过交互式仪表盘提供可视化分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和数学基准测试中展示了其分析能力，并通过用户案例验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR填补了LLM评估中的空白，提供了更具体和可操作的分析工具。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科多语言版本独立编写和更新导致事实不一致，影响其中立性和可靠性，尤其是作为AI系统主要训练数据时。

Method: 开发了一种方法收集、对齐和分析多语言维基百科文章中的表格数据，定义了不一致类别，并应用定量和定性指标评估对齐情况。

Result: 通过样本数据集评估了多语言对齐情况，揭示了不一致性对事实核查和AI系统可靠性的潜在影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为事实核查、多语言知识交互以及利用维基百科内容设计可靠AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

TL;DR: FinDPO是一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的金融领域专用LLM框架，显著提升了情感分析性能，并在实际投资策略中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融文本数据的情感分析对交易决策和市场动态影响日益显著，但现有监督微调（SFT）模型存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出FinDPO框架，通过DPO进行后训练人类偏好对齐，并结合‘logit-to-score’转换生成连续可排序的情感分数。

Result: FinDPO在情感分类基准上平均提升11%，模拟投资策略年回报率达67%，夏普比率为2.0。

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个能在实际交易成本下保持高回报和风险调整性能的情感分析方法。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

TL;DR: AraTable是一个针对阿拉伯语表格数据的新基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的理解和推理能力，填补了该领域的资源空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语表格数据的评估资源稀缺，且现有LLMs在处理此类数据时表现有限，尤其是复杂推理任务。

Method: 采用混合方法，先由LLMs生成初始内容，再由人类专家过滤和验证，确保数据集质量。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）上表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证任务中仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据处理提供了公开资源和评估框架，未来需进一步改进LLMs的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Conclusion: 该研究为孟加拉语标点恢复建立了强基线，并公开了数据集和代码，支持低资源NLP的未来研究。

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Motivation: 解决临床NLP中的稀疏性和隐私问题，通过生成合成医学文本来增强数据、辅助写作、保护隐私等。

Method: 系统综述了94篇相关文献，分析了生成目的、技术和评估方法，重点关注Transformer架构和实用性评估。

Result: 合成医学文本在NLP任务中表现中等，能有效补充真实数据，但隐私问题仍需解决。

Conclusion: 合成医学文本有望加速临床NLP工作流，但需更多人类评估以确保隐私安全。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

TL;DR: GraDe方法通过将稀疏依赖图集成到LLM的注意力机制中，解决了LLM在表格数据生成中注意力分散的问题，显著提升了复杂数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在处理表格数据时，由于其自注意力机制对所有特征对分配注意力，导致关键特征关系被稀释，尤其在复杂依赖或语义模糊的数据集中表现不佳。

Method: 提出GraDe方法，通过轻量级动态图学习模块，结合外部提取的功能依赖关系，优先处理关键特征交互，抑制无关特征。

Result: 实验表明，GraDe在复杂数据集上比现有LLM方法性能提升高达12%，在合成数据质量上与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: GraDe是一种高效且实用的方法，为LLM在表格数据建模中提供了结构感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve

Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合分词策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer分词在捕捉局部DNA序列结构时表现良好，但存在分词分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题。

Method: 通过将独特的6-mer分词与经过600次BPE循环生成的分词结合，形成平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中分别达到10.78%、10.1%和4.12%的准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 混合分词策略能同时捕捉DNA序列的局部和全局信息，为基因组语言建模和下游应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: WINO是一种无需训练的DLLM解码算法，通过并行草稿和验证机制解决现有DLLM的质量与速度权衡问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLM在快速并行生成时存在质量与速度的严重权衡问题，标准解码的不可逆性导致早期错误积累。

Method: 提出WINO算法，采用并行草稿与验证机制，通过双向上下文验证并重新屏蔽可疑标记以优化解码。

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准上加速6倍且准确率提升2.58%，在Flickr30K字幕任务中实现10倍加速且性能更高。

Conclusion: WINO有效解决了DLLM的质量与速度权衡问题，展示了其在多种任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细粒度中文仇恨言论识别任务，提升模型在复杂语境下的表现。

Method: 将四元组提取任务重构为三元组提取，动态检索训练集生成上下文提示，多轮推理投票提高稳定性。

Result: 在STATE ToxiCN数据集上，Hard Score 26.66，Soft Score 48.35，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SRAG-MAV框架有效提升了仇恨言论识别的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents our system for CCL25-Eval Task 10, addressing
Fine-Grained Chinese Hate Speech Recognition (FGCHSR). We propose a novel
SRAG-MAV framework that synergistically integrates task reformulation(TR),
Self-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SRAG), and Multi-Round Accumulative Voting
(MAV). Our method reformulates the quadruplet extraction task into triplet
extraction, uses dynamic retrieval from the training set to create contextual
prompts, and applies multi-round inference with voting to improve output
stability and performance. Our system, based on the Qwen2.5-7B model, achieves
a Hard Score of 26.66, a Soft Score of 48.35, and an Average Score of 37.505 on
the STATE ToxiCN dataset, significantly outperforming baselines such as GPT-4o
(Average Score 15.63) and fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B (Average Score 35.365). The
code is available at https://github.com/king-wang123/CCL25-SRAG-MAV.

*Xiaopeng Ke,Hexuan Deng,Xuebo Liu,Jun Rao,Zhenxi Song,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AQuilt是一个框架，用于从无标签数据中构建特定领域的指令调优数据，通过逻辑和检查增强模型性能，成本仅为DeepSeek-V3的17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在专业领域表现不佳的问题，同时降低现有数据合成方法的高成本和性能限制。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，结合答案、问题、无标签数据、检查、逻辑和任务类型，生成高质量指令调优数据。

Result: 构建了703k样本的数据集，实验显示AQuilt性能与DeepSeek-V3相当，但成本更低，数据与下游任务相关性更高。

Conclusion: AQuilt为专业领域提供了一种高效、低成本的数据合成方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

### [48] [TRPrompt: Bootstrapping Query-Aware Prompt Optimization from Textual Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18618)
*Andreea Nica,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Saibo Geng,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈直接融入提示模型的训练，统一了基于文本反馈和数值奖励的提示优化方法，无需数据集收集，并在GSMHard和MATH数据集上实现了最先进的查询特定提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法分为两类：一类依赖文本反馈，另一类依赖数值奖励训练专用提示模型。TRPrompt旨在统一这两种方法，利用文本反馈直接训练提示模型，提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出TRPrompt框架，通过LLM内部对“好”提示的理解，结合文本反馈的高分辨率信号，迭代优化提示模型，无需预收集数据集。

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH数据集上，TRPrompt生成的查询特定提示达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRPrompt通过文本反馈直接训练提示模型，统一了现有方法，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），通过灵活、指令特定的标准改进语言模型的指令跟随能力，显著提升了多个基准测试的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习使用固定标准（如“有用性”和“无害性”）来调整语言模型，限制了其适应多样化指令的能力。

Method: 从指令中提取清单，结合AI评估和验证程序生成反馈，计算奖励用于强化学习。

Result: RLCF在所有测试基准上均表现优异，包括FollowBench（硬满意度提升4点）、InFoBench（提升6点）和Arena-Hard（胜率提升3点）。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是提升语言模型支持多样化查询需求的关键工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

TL;DR: 研究评估了四种LLM代理通信策略在数学问题解决中的效果，发现双代理优于单代理，其中“同伴协作”表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM代理在AI辅助教育中的通信策略对问题解决效率的影响。

Method: 在OpenAI GPT-4o模型中测试四种通信模式（师生互动、同伴协作、互惠同伴教学、批判性辩论），使用MATH数据集评估。

Result: 双代理优于单代理，同伴协作模式准确率最高；对话行为（如陈述、确认、提示）对协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 多代理框架提升计算任务效率，但有效通信策略是解决AI教育中复杂问题的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Method: 集成Whisper转录和GPT-4o模块化学习流程，生成SOAP笔记；后处理使用BART模型优化简洁性。

Result: 生成的笔记质量优于专家手写笔记，540名医生使用，94%报告认知负担减轻，97%文书负担减少。

Conclusion: AI系统能有效减轻行政负担，提升临床效率和质量。

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Motivation: 探讨社交媒体平台如何通过不同设计和内容模式影响男性青少年的身体形象认知。

Method: 采用平台化视角，对395名10至24岁男性青少年进行问卷调查，使用MBSRQ-AS评估身体形象。

Result: 抖音使用与外貌评价和身体满意度显著相关，微信使用则无显著关联。

Conclusion: 平台特性对社交媒体影响身体形象至关重要，抖音的视频驱动算法加剧了理想化身体标准的暴露。

Abstract: In the digital era, social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping
adolescents' body image perceptions. This study examines how Douyin and WeChat,
two contrasting Chinese social media platforms, influence body image among
Chinese male adolescents. Employing a platformization perspective, we surveyed
395 male adolescents aged 10 to 24 using the Multidimensional Body-Self
Relations Questionnaire-Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) to assess self-evaluation
and body satisfaction. Our findings reveal that Douyin usage is significantly
correlated with appearance evaluation and body area satisfaction, while WeChat
usage shows no significant correlation with any body image dimensions. These
results suggest that Douyin's algorithm-driven, video-centric environment
intensifies exposure to idealized body standards, impacting users at a
cognitive level. This study underscores the importance of considering
platform-specific characteristics in understanding social media's impact on
body image. It contributes to the broader discourse on how technological design
and content modalities mediate psychological outcomes, offering insights for
addressing body image concerns among male adolescents in China.

an exploration of its real-world use and the potential of additional data
streams. To facilitate this, we contribute the BrisT1D Dataset to the growing
number of public T1D management datasets. The dataset was developed from a
longitudinal study of 24 young adults in the UK who used a smartwatch alongside
their usual T1D management. Findings: The BrisT1D dataset features both device
data from the T1D management systems and smartwatches used by participants, as
well as transcripts of monthly interviews and focus groups conducted during the
study. The device data is provided in a processed state, for usability and more
rapid analysis, and in a raw state, for in-depth exploration of novel insights
captured in the study. Conclusions: This dataset has a range of potential
applications. The quantitative elements can support blood glucose prediction,
hypoglycaemia prediction, and closed-loop algorithm development. The
qualitative elements enable the exploration of user experiences and opinions,

Motivation: 传统宿舍管理效率低下、沟通不畅，无法满足数字化时代学生需求，增加了管理负担。

Method: DHMS采用模块化设计，结合人工智能和云计算，自动化房间分配、投诉处理等功能，并配备自然语言聊天机器人。

Result: 模拟测试显示，DHMS在房间分配上获得92%学生满意度，聊天机器人响应时间低于1秒。

Conclusion: DHMS表现良好，但需进一步测试集成性、用户接受度、负载扩展性和ERP兼容性。

Abstract: Traditional hostel management practices in academic institutions often suffer
from inefficiencies, delays, and fragmented communication. These systems fail
to meet the expectations of digitally native students and place a significant
operational burden on hostel staff. This paper introduces DHMS (Digital Hostel
Management System), a modular and integrated platform designed to digitize and
streamline essential hostel management functions. DHMS leverages modern web
technologies, artificial intelligence, and cloud infrastructure to automate
room allotment, grievance redressal, gate pass logistics, and communication via
a natural language chatbot. In simulation tests, DHMS achieved a 92% student
satisfaction rate in room allocation and maintained an average chatbot response
time below one second. Additional features include predictive analytics for
proactive maintenance planning and sentiment analysis for feedback processing.
While promising, the system requires further testing for integration across
multiple hostel blocks, user acceptance, scalability under load, and ERP
compatibility before campus-wide deployment. This work discusses the system
architecture, implementation approach, and factors critical to improving user
experience, administrative efficiency, and decision-making processes.

Result: 提出了一个能够生成用户友好且基于数据来源的解释的交互式代理。

Conclusion: 该交互式代理有望提升用户对AI系统输出的理解，同时保持解释的准确性。

Abstract: Modern AI systems are complex workflows containing multiple components and
data sources. Data provenance provides the ability to interrogate and
potentially explain the outputs of these systems. However, provenance is often
too detailed and not contextualized for the user trying to understand the AI
system. In this work, we present our vision for an interactive agent that works
together with the user to co-construct an explanation that is simultaneously
useful to the user as well as grounded in data provenance. To illustrate this
vision, we present: 1) an initial prototype of such an agent; and 2) a scalable
evaluation framework based on user simulations and a large language model as a
judge approach.

integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of
traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the
emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for
automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual
conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of
large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles
of proposal, critique, and revision.

Conclusion: 研究表明，支持多用户群体的可视化设计能够提升工具的整体效用，同时兼顾通用性和特定任务需求。

Abstract: Domain-specific visualizations sometimes focus on narrow, albeit important,
tasks for one group of users. This focus limits the utility of a visualization
to other groups working with the same data. While tasks elicited from other
groups can present a design pitfall if not disambiguated, they also present a
design opportunity -- development of visualizations that support multiple
groups. This development choice presents a trade off of broadening the scope
but limiting support for the more narrow tasks of any one group, which in some
cases can enhance the overall utility of the visualization. We investigate this
scenario through a design study where we develop \textit{Guidepost}, a
notebook-embedded visualization of supercomputer queue data that helps
scientists assess supercomputer queue wait times, machine learning researchers
understand prediction accuracy, and system maintainers analyze usage trends. We
adapt the use of personas for visualization design from existing literature in
the HCI and software engineering domains and apply them in categorizing tasks
based on their uniqueness across the stakeholder personas. Under this model,
tasks shared between all groups should be supported by interactive
visualizations and tasks unique to each group can be deferred to scripting with
notebook-embedded visualization design. We evaluate our visualization with nine
expert analysts organized into two groups: a "research analyst" group that uses
supercomputer queue data in their research (representing the Machine Learning
researchers and Jobs Data Analyst personas) and a "supercomputer user" group
that uses this data conditionally (representing the HPC User persona). We find
that our visualization serves our three stakeholder groups by enabling users to
successfully execute shared tasks with point-and-click interaction while
facilitating case-specific programmatic analysis workflows.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动标注或车辆控制信号，无法适用于大规模数据或无控制信号的情况，因此需要一种新的自动化方法。

Method: 开发了一种基于分段线性加速度模型的算法，并提出了手动标注方法作为验证基准。

Result: 算法通过R2作为置信度指标验证，在自然碰撞避免数据中表现良好，具有高效性、通用性和可配置性。

Conclusion: 该算法为ADS评估提供了高效且通用的解决方案，尽管存在一定局限性，但适用于多种场景和道路使用者。

Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated
driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not
limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver
response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human
driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and
a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual
annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal
movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data
where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for
the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding
road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques
for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are
not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a
piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that
can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal
time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake
onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence
metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification
performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both
ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.
Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,
generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly
configurable.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

scalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can
identify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this
setting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of
fields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare
two basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed
views of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we
investigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level
of spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's
results illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while
also highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments
made in assessing spatial correlation. Supplemental material is available at

*Nisha Devasia,Georgia Kenderova,Michele Newman,Julie Kientz,Jin Ha Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了电子游戏中eudaimonic体验（与个人意义和成长相关）的感知结果及其形成要素，填补了现有理论中对效果研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注游戏的享乐体验，而对eudaimonic体验的效果及其如何影响个体积极结果的研究不足。

Method: 通过混合方法分析166名受访者的调查数据，分类效果并识别其形成的关键子成分。

Result: 发现有意义游戏体验能带来反思、学习、社交、健康和职业等积极效果。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了eudaimonic游戏体验的理论模型，为研究者和从业者提供了促进玩家积极结果的依据。

Abstract: While much of the research in digital games has emphasized hedonic
experiences, such as flow, enjoyment, and positive affect, recent years have
seen increased interest in eudaimonic gaming experiences, typically
mixed-affect and associated with personal meaningfulness and growth. The
formation of such experiences in games is theorized to have four constituent
elements: motivation, game use, experience, and effects. However, while the
first three elements have been relatively well explored in the literature, the
effects - and how they may influence positive individual outcomes - have been
underexplored thus far. To this end, in this work, we investigate the perceived
outcomes of eudaimonic gaming and how different components of the experience
influence these effects. We conducted a survey (n = 166) in which respondents
recounted meaningful gaming experiences and how they affected their present
lives. We used a mixed-methods approach to classify effects and identify
significant subcomponents of their formation. We contribute an empirical
understanding of how meaningful gaming experiences can lead to positive
reflective, learning, social, health, and career effects, extending current
theoretical models of eudaimonic gaming experiences and offering implications
for how researchers and practitioners might use these findings to promote
positive outcomes for players.

*Benjamin Watson,Neff Walker,William Ribarsky,Victoria Spaulding*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了虚拟环境中的系统响应性（SR），分析了其统计特性（MSR和SDSR）对抓取和放置任务性能的影响，发现SDSR仅在超过82 ms时影响性能，且放置任务对SR更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨系统响应性（SR）在虚拟环境中的影响，以优化人机交互设计。

Method: 通过三项实验（分别有11、12和10名参与者）研究MSR和SDSR对任务性能的影响。

Result: SDSR仅在超过82 ms时影响性能；放置任务对SR更敏感，需要更频繁的视觉反馈。

Conclusion: 虚拟环境设计无需严格控制SDSR，可根据视觉反馈需求调整SR控制，适用于多种交互式图形应用。

Abstract: System responsiveness (SR) is defined as the elapsed time until a system
responds to user control. SR fluctuates over time, so it must be described
statistically with mean (MSR) and standard deviation (SDSR). In this paper, we
examine SR in virtual environments (VEs), outlining its components and methods
of experimental measurement and manipulation. Three studies of MSR and SDSR
effects on performance of grasp and placement tasks are then presented. The
studies used within-subjects designs with 11, 12, and 10 participants,
respectively. Results showed that SDSR affected performance only if it was
above 82 ms. Placement required more frequent visual feedback and was more
sensitive to SR. We infer that VE designers need not tightly control SDSR and
may wish to vary SR control based on required visual feedback frequency. These
results may be used to improve the human-computer interface in a wide range of
interactive graphical applications, including scientific visualization,
training, mental health, and entertainment.

*Shizhen Zhang,Shengxin Li,Quan Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Understood是一个基于混合现实（MR）的系统，旨在帮助成人ADHD患者在现实世界中进行沟通，通过实时对话摘要、上下文感知的词汇建议和话题转移检测功能，有效减轻认知负担并提高沟通效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人ADHD患者因执行功能障碍和情绪失调面临沟通挑战，现有干预措施多针对儿童，缺乏适用于成人的日常沟通支持工具。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈和设计研讨会确定需求，开发了基于Microsoft HoloLens 2的MR系统，包含实时对话摘要、词汇建议和话题转移检测功能。

Result: 用户研究和专家访谈表明，Understood在支持沟通方面效果显著，具有高可用性。

Conclusion: Understood为成人ADHD患者提供了一种有效的沟通辅助工具，可作为治疗干预的补充。

Abstract: Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience
communication challenges, primarily due to executive dysfunction and emotional
dysregulation, even after years of social integration. While existing
interventions predominantly target children through structured or intrusive
methods, adults lack tools that translate clinical strategies into daily
communication support. To address this gap, we present Understood, a Mixed
Reality (MR) system implemented on Microsoft HoloLens 2, designed to assist
adults with ADHD in real-world communication. Through formative semi-structured
interviews and a design workshop, we identified critical communication barriers
and derived design goals for the system. Understood combines three key
features: (1) real-time conversation summarization to reduce cognitive load,
(2) context-aware subsequent word suggestions during moments of disfluency, and
(3) topic shifting detection and reminding to mitigate off-topic transitions. A
within-subjects user study and expert interviews demonstrate that Understood
effectively supports communication with high usability, offering a complement
to therapist-mediated interventions.

*Yuheng Zhao,Xueli Shu,Liwen Fan,Lin Gao,Yu Zhang,Siming Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为ProactiveVA的框架，通过LLM驱动的UI代理主动监控用户交互并提供上下文感知的辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM辅助的VA系统仅在用户明确请求时提供帮助，无法在用户最需要时主动提供建议。

Method: 通过形成性研究分析用户交互日志中的求助行为，设计了三阶段的UI代理流程（感知、推理、行动）。

Result: 在两种代表性VA系统中实现了框架，并通过算法评估、案例和专家研究及用户研究验证了有效性。

Conclusion: ProactiveVA框架能主动识别用户需求并提供定制化建议，同时讨论了设计权衡和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Visual analytics (VA) is typically applied to complex data, thus requiring
complex tools. While visual analytics empowers analysts in data analysis,
analysts may get lost in the complexity occasionally. This highlights the need
for intelligent assistance mechanisms. However, even the latest LLM-assisted VA
systems only provide help when explicitly requested by the user, making them
insufficiently intelligent to offer suggestions when analysts need them the
most. We propose a ProactiveVA framework in which LLM-powered UI agent monitors
user interactions and delivers context-aware assistance proactively. To design
effective proactive assistance, we first conducted a formative study analyzing
help-seeking behaviors in user interaction logs, identifying when users need
proactive help, what assistance they require, and how the agent should
intervene. Based on this analysis, we distilled key design requirements in
terms of intent recognition, solution generation, interpretability and
controllability. Guided by these requirements, we develop a three-stage UI
agent pipeline including perception, reasoning, and acting. The agent
autonomously perceives users' needs from VA interaction logs, providing
tailored suggestions and intuitive guidance through interactive exploration of
the system. We implemented the framework in two representative types of VA
systems, demonstrating its generalizability, and evaluated the effectiveness
through an algorithm evaluation, case and expert study and a user study. We
also discuss current design trade-offs of proactive VA and areas for further
exploration.

TL;DR: 研究通过访谈意大利音乐听众，分析其对推荐系统的理解，揭示听众对推荐系统的认知不足及性别差异问题，强调跨学科研究和数字素养的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推荐系统在音乐收听中的代表性危害，尤其是从心理社会和文化角度分析听众的认知。

Method: 访谈意大利音乐听众，采用情感文本分析法分析其叙述。

Result: 发现听众对推荐系统缺乏批判性理解，性别差异问题未被充分认识。

Conclusion: 需跨学科研究和提升算法意识与数字素养，以构建可信的推荐系统。

Abstract: Recommender systems shape music listening worldwide due to their widespread
adoption in online platforms. Growing concerns about representational harms
that these systems may cause are nowadays part of the scientific and public
debate, wherein music listener perspectives are oftentimes reported and
discussed from a cognitive-behaviorism perspective, but rarely contextualised
under a psychosocial and cultural lens. We proceed in this direction, by
interviewing a group of Italian music listeners and analysing their narratives
through Emotional Textual Analysis. Thanks to this, we identify shared cultural
repertoires that reveal people's complex relationship with listening practices:
even when familiar with online platforms, listeners may still lack a critical
understanding of recommender systems. Moreover, representational issues,
particularly gender disparities, seem not yet fully grasped in the context of
online music listening. This study underscores the need for interdisciplinary
research to address representational harms, and the role of algorithmic
awareness and digital literacy in developing trustworthy recommender systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态人机协作框架，用于从眼动追踪数据中提取认知模式，结合专家判断和LLM推理，提高了分析的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼动追踪数据能揭示用户的认知状态，但其结构化和非语言特性使分析困难。LLMs擅长文本推理，但对时间和数值数据处理能力有限。

Method: 框架包括多阶段管道（水平和垂直分割与LLM推理）、专家-模型共评分模块（结合专家判断和LLM输出）和混合异常检测模块（LSTM时间建模与LLM语义分析）。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在一致性、可解释性和性能上均有提升，难度预测任务准确率最高达50%。

Conclusion: 该方法为认知建模提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案，适用于自适应学习、人机交互和教育分析等领域。

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语音不流畅对人类-机器对话（HMD）中视角采择和听众设计的影响，发现不流畅的语音代理被认为更胜任，但未显著影响对话灵活性或拟人化评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音不流畅在HMD中的作用，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 61名参与者通过Namer-Matcher任务与流畅或不流畅的语音代理互动，前后填写伙伴建模问卷（PMQ）。

Result: 不流畅代理被认为更胜任，但未显著影响其他评价；不流畅代理可能增加自我中心沟通。

Conclusion: 语音不流畅可能影响HMD中的伙伴模型和语言生成，但效果尚不明确。

Abstract: Speech disfluencies play a role in perspective-taking and audience design in
human-human communication (HHC), but little is known about their impact in
human-machine dialogue (HMD). In an online Namer-Matcher task, sixty-one
participants interacted with a speech agent using either fluent or disfluent
speech. Participants completed a partner-modelling questionnaire (PMQ) both
before and after the task. Post-interaction evaluations indicated that
participants perceived the disfluent agent as more competent, despite no
significant differences in pre-task ratings. However, no notable differences
were observed in assessments of conversational flexibility or human-likeness.
Our findings also reveal evidence of egocentric and allocentric language
production when participants interact with speech agents. Interaction with
disfluent speech agents appears to increase egocentric communication in
comparison to fluent agents. Although the wide credibility intervals mean this
effect is not clear-cut. We discuss potential interpretations of this finding,
focusing on how disfluencies may impact partner models and language production
in HMD.

TL;DR: PALM是一种学习分析仪表盘，通过整合课程级信息解决学习分析的可扩展性问题，提升学生对学习行为和学术进展的认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习分析研究多关注单一课程或学习者，缺乏对课程间关系及长期学习轨迹的框架。PALM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发PALM，整合多层教育数据到课程地图中，并通过系统评估其对学生学习行为意识和系统性能的影响。

Result: PALM显著提升学生对学习规划和反思的认知，视觉化和统计趋势展示增强了行为控制感，且在视觉吸引力和可用性上优于现有系统。

Conclusion: PALM作为信息资源和自我调节学习工具，代表了学习分析向全面可扩展方法的重要进展。

Abstract: This study proposes and evaluates the PAnoramic Learning Map (PALM), a
learning analytics (LA) dashboard designed to address the scalability
challenges of LA by integrating curriculum-level information. Traditional LA
research has predominantly focused on individual courses or learners and often
lacks a framework that considers the relationships between courses and the
long-term trajectory of learning. To bridge this gap, PALM was developed to
integrate multilayered educational data into a curriculum map, enabling
learners to intuitively understand their learning records and academic
progression. We conducted a system evaluation to assess PALM's effectiveness in
two key areas: (1) its impact on students' awareness of their learning
behaviors, and (2) its comparative performance against existing systems. The
results indicate that PALM enhances learners' awareness of study planning and
reflection, particularly by improving perceived behavioral control through the
visual presentation of individual learning histories and statistical trends,
which clarify the links between learning actions and outcomes. Although PALM
requires ongoing refinement as a system, it received significantly higher
evaluations than existing systems in terms of visual appeal and usability. By
serving as an information resource with previously inaccessible insights, PALM
enhances self-regulated learning and engagement, representing a significant
step beyond conventional LA toward a comprehensive and scalable approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多感官整合在日常生活和沉浸技术中至关重要，但三模态以上的整合研究较少，需要更深入探索。

Method: 分析多感官整合中的跨模态对应、一致性、认知负荷和刺激时间等关键因素。

Result: 提出了如何将这些因素应用于设计有效的多感官整合研究协议。

Conclusion: 多感官整合研究需综合考虑多种因素，以更全面地理解其机制。

Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create
a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies.
Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the
interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and
characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the
integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must
account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive
load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities
multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied
to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

Conclusion: 该框架为决策中心的可视化研究提供了更精确的工具，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Decision-making is a central yet under-defined goal in visualization
research. While existing task models address decision processes, they often
neglect the conditions framing a decision. To better support decision-making
tasks, we propose a characterization scheme that describes decision problems
through key properties of the data, users, and task context. This scheme helps
visualization researchers specify decision-support claims more precisely and
informs the design of appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to characterize decision
tasks targeted by existing design studies, highlighting opportunities for
future research in decision-centric visualization.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ForcePinch是一种新型力响应空间交互方法，通过捏合力调节指针跟踪速度，平衡效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术将跟踪速度调整与手部运动直接耦合，降低了交互灵活性。受物理世界中自然摩擦控制的启发，提出ForcePinch。

Method: 开发硬件原型，集成压力传感器和可定制映射函数，将捏合力转换为跟踪速度调整。

Result: 用户研究表明，ForcePinch在1D、2D和3D任务中表现优于Go-Go和PRISM技术。

Conclusion: 力响应交互具有上下文意义和多功能性，为未来空间交互设计提供启发。

Abstract: Spatial interaction in 3D environments requires balancing efficiency and
precision, which requires dynamic tracking speed adjustments. However, existing
techniques often couple tracking speed adjustments directly with hand
movements, reducing interaction flexibility. Inspired by the natural friction
control inherent in the physical world, we introduce ForcePinch, a novel
force-responsive spatial interaction method that enables users to intuitively
modulate pointer tracking speed and smoothly transition between rapid and
precise movements by varying their pinching force. To implement this concept,
we developed a hardware prototype integrating a pressure sensor with a
customizable mapping function that translates pinching force into tracking
speed adjustments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants performing
well-established 1D, 2D, and 3D object manipulation tasks, comparing ForcePinch
against the distance-responsive technique Go-Go and speed-responsive technique
PRISM. Results highlight distinctive characteristics of the force-responsive
approach across different interaction contexts. Drawing on these findings, we
highlight the contextual meaning and versatility of force-responsive
interactions through four illustrative examples, aiming to inform and inspire
future spatial interaction design.

Result: 用户研究表明PosterMate能捕捉被忽视的观点，并有效整合不同角色代理的反馈。

Conclusion: PosterMate展示了生成式AI在设计反馈中的潜力，可作为有效的原型工具。

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Conclusion: DLB工具在支持研究可重复性方面具有潜力，未来可进一步优化以适应不同环境需求。

Abstract: Ensuring reproducibility of research is an integral part of good scientific
practice. One way to support this is through provenance: information about
research workflows from data gathering to researchers' sensemaking processes
leading to published results. This is highly important in disciplines such as
geosciences, where researchers use software for interactive and immersive
visualizations of geospatial data, doing virtual measurements in simulated
fieldwork on 3D models. We evaluated a provenance management tool, which allows
recording of interactions with a virtual fieldwork tool and annotating
different states of the visualization. The user study investigated how
researchers used this Digital Lab Book (DLB) and whether perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness differed between groups in immersive or non-immersive
settings. Participants perceived the DLB as both useful and easy to use. While
there were indications of differences in perceived ease of use (higher for
immersive setting), usage patterns showed no significant group differences.

requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA是一种用于数据分析的代理架构，通过结构化推理过程模拟认知步骤，优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统在数据分析中忽略了结构化推理过程，导致推理步骤缺乏一致性。

Method: 提出I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务模拟认知步骤，实现结构化推理。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I-STRADA在规划一致性和洞察对齐方面表现优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析代理设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an

Motivation: 解决非确定性自动机在规划策略合成中需要昂贵确定性步骤的问题。

Method: 识别定性时间线规划的一个片段，将其映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题。

Result: 确定了适合确定性片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 该片段为直接合成规划策略提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正的创造力，提出“创意潜力隐藏在失败中”的理念。

Method: 采用LLaMA-2-7B-Chat等模型，结合结构化提示、语义评分和人类反馈，通过复合奖励函数（新颖性、惊喜度和相关性）优化生成。

Result: 创造力评分提升70.4%，精炼后的标语更短、更新颖，跨模态测试显示强对齐，人类评价中60%输出得分≥4.0。

Conclusion: 错误驱动和反馈驱动的生成方法能有效增强AI创造力，为自进化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图表是否对AI系统分析数据有帮助。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5进行实验，对比不同图表条件下的表现。

Result: AI系统在数据伴随散点图时表现更精确，图表内容对提升性能起关键作用。

Conclusion: 初步证明AI系统也能从可视化中受益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中式训练或缺乏理论保证。

Method: MAGPO采用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并明确与分散式策略对齐以确保可部署性。

Result: 在6个环境的43个任务中，MAGPO表现优于基线CTDE方法，并匹配或超越完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究受限于人类认知能力，ASI-Arch旨在通过自主创新突破这一瓶颈。

Method: ASI-Arch通过自主假设、实现、训练和验证新型架构，完成端到端研究，进行了1,773次实验。

Result: 发现了106种创新架构，性能超越人类设计，并首次建立了科学发现的规模定律。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为AI自主加速研究提供了蓝图，将研究进程从人类限制转向计算可扩展。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗机器学习部署成本高且流程复杂，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过模块化任务代理（如数据匿名化、特征提取、模型匹配等）实现从数据摄入到推理的全流程自动化。

Result: 在老年医学、姑息治疗和结肠镜成像数据集上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架减少了专家干预需求，为临床AI提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床试验中安全数据收集时间有限，且疫苗广泛接种后需要快速监测潜在安全问题，因此需要开发一种高效的方法来从急诊科分诊笔记中提取相关信息。

Method: 研究采用NLP技术和主动学习方法，结合数据增强和主动学习评估技术，开发了一个分类器，用于从急诊科分诊笔记中识别疫苗安全问题。

Result: 该方法能够更准确、高效地检测疫苗安全问题，减少误报，并优化标注数据的质量和模型性能。

Conclusion: 结合NLP和主动学习的技术可以有效提升疫苗安全监测的效率和准确性，为公共卫生决策提供支持。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同聚合函数对GNNs表达能力的影响，特别是均值聚合的局限性。

Method: 通过非均匀和均匀设置下的理论分析，比较均值聚合GNNs与其他聚合函数的表达能力。

Result: 均值聚合GNNs在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，但在均匀设置下表达能力较弱。

Conclusion: 均值聚合GNNs的表达能力受设置和假设条件限制，灵活性较低。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知归因框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）的知识和推理能力解耦，通过快速和慢速思维模式分析其贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分LLMs的知识和推理能力对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要。

Method: 通过快速和慢速思维模式分别生成答案，分解为知识检索（Phase 1）和推理调整（Phase 2），并分析不同模式下的表现。

Result: （1）推理调整具有领域特异性；（2）参数扩展提升知识和推理能力，但对知识提升更显著；（3）知识主要分布在低层网络，推理在高层。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解LLMs提供了新视角，并对扩展定律、分层知识编辑和小模型推理限制等研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Conclusion: 提供了一个统一的非最小化析取语义框架，比传统方法更灵活。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

Result: 提供了一种逻辑化的AI风险分析哲学基础，支持对高风险AI和通用AI系统的评估。

Conclusion: 未来工作将开发形式化模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Conclusion: 方法有效，能够自动化批改物理考试答案，但项重写系统的开发和验证具有挑战性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和RL算法中验证了IB正则化的有效性，性能一致提升。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，并通过轻量级方法显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化学习在呼叫中心路由优化中的应用，比较了基于模型的Value Iteration和无模型的Proximal Policy Optimisation方法，PPO表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化呼叫中心的路由策略，以减少客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Method: 比较了基于模型的Value Iteration（已知系统动态）和无模型的PPO（从经验中学习），使用MDP框架和SBR模型。

Result: 经过1,000次测试，PPO在奖励、客户等待时间和员工闲置时间上表现最优，尽管训练时间较长。

Conclusion: PPO是优化呼叫中心路由的有效方法，尽管训练成本较高。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Motivation: 传统CPU在处理包含大量有效案例的表约束问题时效率不足，需要利用GPU的并行计算能力提升性能。

Method: 设计并实现了GPU加速的CT算法，并将其集成到现有约束求解器中。

Result: 通过实验验证，GPU加速的CT算法在大量实例中表现优异。

Conclusion: GPU加速的CT算法为处理大规模表约束问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Conclusion: 强调了训练数据在概念探测中的重要性，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

TL;DR: QuaRC框架通过核心集选择和层校正策略，在边缘设备上高效进行量化感知训练，显著提升了低比特量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上量化模型的需求增加，但传统QAT依赖完整数据集且计算成本高，同时隐私问题限制了数据使用。

Method: 提出QuaRC框架，包括基于相对熵分的核心集选择和层校正策略，以减少量化误差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，2-bit量化的ResNet-18使用1%数据子集时，Top-1准确率提升5.72%。

Conclusion: QuaRC有效解决了小规模数据集下的量化误差问题，提升了边缘设备上量化模型的性能。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 解决用户数据多样性和知识分歧问题，提升语义通信中数据重建的鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义通信中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于多样化和动态数据环境。

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Conclusion: 调整特征网络的自相似度可显著提升特定深度神经网络的分类性能，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

Result: 动态策略平均减少81%的LLM调用，基于置信度的改进进一步减少至87%，准确性损失较小。

Conclusion: 动态早停方法有效降低计算成本，适用于不同规模和任务的LLM。

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Conclusion: CICME能有效推断多领域数据的因果机制，为复杂系统分析提供新工具。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Conclusion: LSDM在移动流量预测中表现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性，为网络效率和服务质量提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

TL;DR: GenSelect利用LLM的长推理能力从N个候选方案中选择最佳方案，优于现有评分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（点式评分或成对比较）未能充分利用LLM的比较能力或扩展效率低。

Method: 提出GenSelect方法，通过长推理从并行采样的候选方案中选择最佳方案。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，GenSelect优于现有评分方法。

Conclusion: GenSelect有效结合了LLM的比较能力与高效扩展性。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）进行降水降尺度预测，与传统神经网络相比，WGAN生成的降水场视觉上更真实，尽管在传统评估指标上表现略低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率降水预测对减少局部强降雨的损害至关重要，但传统数值天气预报模型在此方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用WGAN进行降水降尺度预测，利用最优传输成本生成降水场。

Result: WGAN生成的降水场视觉上更真实，且其判别器得分与人类感知的真实性相关。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提升了降水降尺度的视觉真实性，还为降水数据集的评估和质量控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

TL;DR: GraphEXT是一个新的GNN可解释性框架，利用合作博弈论和社会外部性概念，通过节点联盟和子图分解量化节点重要性，显著提升GNN的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的“黑盒”特性及其难以捕捉节点间复杂交互模式的问题，促使开发GraphEXT以增强GNN的可解释性。

Method: GraphEXT将图节点划分为联盟，分解为独立子图，结合图结构作为外部性，利用Shapley值量化节点在GNN预测中的边际贡献。

Result: 实验表明，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构上均优于现有基线方法，显著提高了模型的保真度和可解释性。

Conclusion: GraphEXT通过强调节点交互和结构变化的影响，为GNN提供了一种更有效的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Result: 在20个零样本实验中，生成分子更成功且多样；双目标和少样本任务中，多样性提升且保持理想属性。

Conclusion: 分子任务算术因其简单、高效和性能，有望成为分子设计的标准迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Result: MFNO在分辨率泛化上表现优异，性能优于基线模型，且样本路径生成速度显著快于传统数值方法。

Conclusion: MFNO是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于学习随机系统动态，尤其在处理非周期性输入和计算效率上具有优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

Motivation: 探讨在公共数据与私有数据分布存在显著偏移时，差分隐私机器学习算法的性能，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 扩展了公共-私有学习的下界理论，应用于高斯均值估计和线性回归中数据分布偏移的场景。

Result: 偏移较小时，需大量公共或私有数据估计私有参数；偏移较大时，公共数据无帮助。

Conclusion: 数据分布偏移程度决定了公共数据在差分隐私机器学习中的价值，需根据偏移调整数据使用策略。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习需要数据集中存储，而FL通过分布式设备训练共享模型，解决了隐私和数据分散问题。云机器人操作受限于计算资源，FL为其提供了灵活性和可靠性。

Method: 介绍了FL的基本概念及其与云机器人操作的关联，探讨了在集中式或分散式环境中设计和验证FL模型的方法。

Result: FL为云机器人操作提供了高效和可靠的解决方案，但也面临挑战。

Conclusion: FL在云机器人操作中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以解决实际应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Motivation: 目标是解决传统方法计算成本高的问题，通过深度学习生成具有特定水力特性的多孔超材料。

Method: 结合变分自编码器（VAE）和回归器构建pVAE，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）预测水力特性，并通过LBM生成数据。

Result: pVAE框架成功生成具有定制特性的多孔结构，显著降低计算成本，并提供了潜在空间的详细分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为多孔超材料的逆向设计提供了高效工具，数据集和代码将开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为HTSR理论中的关键量（如alpha和alpha-hat）提供形式化解释，并探索理想学习的数学前提。

Method: 结合统计力学、随机矩阵理论和量子化学方法，推导出SETOL理论，并通过3层MLP和SOTA神经网络验证。

Result: SETOL与HTSR的alpha度量在MLP和SOTA神经网络中表现一致，验证了理论假设。

Conclusion: SETOL为神经网络性能预测提供了新工具，并提出了新的学习度量ERG。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Motivation: 当前对抗性提示生成方法存在人类生成规模小、机器生成缺乏真实性的问题，需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Seed2Harvest方法，通过引导扩展人类生成的对抗性提示种子，结合机器计算能力生成多样化的提示。

Result: 生成的提示集在攻击成功率（0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16）和多样性（535个地理位置，Shannon熵7.48）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 人类与机器协作能有效提升对抗性提示的多样性和真实性，为T2I模型的安全评估提供全面且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse通过高效迁移学习，为高分辨率AI城市预测的跨城市实际部署迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

Conclusion: MFTRR通过模拟人类认知过程，有效解决了帖子质量评估中的关键问题，展现了多模态和细粒度推理的优势。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

TL;DR: SIFOTL是一种隐私保护且抗噪声的表格学习方法，通过提取隐私合规的统计摘要、使用XGBoost和LLM分离信号与噪声，并通过决策树识别数据偏移的成因，在医疗数据中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据中的隐私限制和复杂噪声使得数据偏移分析困难，需要一种既能保护隐私又能处理噪声的方法。

Method: SIFOTL结合隐私合规统计摘要、XGBoost模型和LLM，通过Pareto加权决策树识别数据偏移的成因。

Result: 在MEPS数据集上F1得分为0.85，优于基线方法；在18个EHR数据集上F1为0.86-0.96（无噪声）和≥0.75（有噪声）。

Conclusion: SIFOTL提供了一种隐私保护、抗噪声且可解释的数据偏移分析方法。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式TSEP-Machine Unlearning，用于选择性遗忘敏感、有毒或过时的数据，以提升交通状态估计与预测的信任度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的交通状态估计与预测（TSEP）依赖敏感数据，但隐私、网络安全和数据新鲜度问题可能削弱公众对智能交通系统的信任。法规要求支持“被遗忘权”，但传统方法无法完全删除数据。

Method: 引入TSEP-Machine Unlearning范式，使训练后的TSEP模型能够选择性遗忘隐私敏感、有毒或过时的数据。

Result: 通过“遗忘”机制，提升了数据驱动TSEP的可信度和可靠性。

Conclusion: TSEP-Machine Unlearning为解决隐私和信任问题提供了有效途径，增强了智能交通系统的实用性。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种预测框架，用于优化基于GRPO的大型语言模型微调资源使用，通过实验总结出经验性扩展规律，并发现训练可分三个阶段，提前停止可节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）使用GRPO等方法进行微调时计算成本高昂，亟需优化资源利用。

Method: 提出预测框架，建模训练动态，通过实验（Llama和Qwen模型）总结扩展规律，识别训练阶段。

Result: 发现训练分为三个阶段（缓慢启动、快速提升、平台期），并确定提前停止点以减少计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效GRPO微调提供了实用指导，适用于多种模型类型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率海洋数据对沿海管理、环境监测和海上安全至关重要，但现有卫星数据（如Copernicus）和全球海洋模型缺乏足够的空间分辨率。

Method: 采用监督深度学习框架，基于神经算子解决偏微分方程，并提出降尺度模型应用于Copernicus海洋数据。

Result: 模型在真实Copernicus海洋数据和合成Navier-Stokes模拟数据集上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该方法能够建模替代偏微分方程，并在任意输入分辨率下预测解，为高分辨率海洋数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-AAE结合匿名自编码器（AAE）和自适应差分脉冲编码调制（ADPCM），有效保护可穿戴传感器数据的隐私，同时保持活动识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器的行为数据可能泄露用户身份，需在医疗应用中保护隐私。

Method: C-AAE通过AAE将传感器数据投影到保留活动特征但抑制身份信息的潜在空间，再用ADPCM进一步编码以降低数据量和掩蔽身份信息。

Result: 实验显示C-AAE将用户重识别F1分数降低10-15个百分点，活动识别F1分数仅下降5个百分点，数据量减少75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE在医疗传感器数据中平衡了隐私保护和实用性。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM是一种低比特量化框架，通过混合精度量化将LLM的权重压缩10倍，平均1.6比特/权重，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署困难，因其参数庞大且计算成本高，极低比特量化（<=2比特）常导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Squeeze10-LLM，采用分阶段混合精度后训练量化（PTQ），80%权重量化为1比特，20%为4比特。引入PBAR（量化对激活的影响）和FIAS（保留完整激活信息）两项创新。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2上，Squeeze10-LLM在6个零样本分类任务中平均准确率从43%提升至56%，优于现有PTQ方法。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM在亚2比特量化中实现最优性能，为LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在训练数据有限的情况下，如何利用额外的监督信息（如置信度）提升分类模型的准确性。

Method: 将硬标签和额外监督视为概率分布，通过它们的仿射组合构建软标签，并进行理论分析。

Conclusion: 实验证明，基于理论设计的额外监督能提升分类准确性，即使简单使用也有效。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Result: PDA-DRL比基线方法平均延迟降低38%，个性化方法优于传统聚合策略。

Conclusion: PDA-DRL和个性化权重共享方法在O-RAN中高效且实用。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Result: 前缀置信度扩展在准确性与计算效率上优于多数投票，且对长度偏差的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度扩展是一种有效的自我改进方法，优于测试时训练。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Conclusion: GraphALP为类别不平衡且标签噪声的图节点分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Motivation: 现实数据集中噪声标签会降低深度神经网络的泛化性能，现有方法未能充分利用学习过程中的时间动态信息。

Method: 提出ChronoSelect框架，采用四阶段记忆架构和滑动更新机制，压缩预测历史为紧凑时间分布，通过时间轨迹分析和双分支一致性实现样本分区。

Result: 理论证明框架在噪声条件下的收敛性和稳定性，实验验证其在合成和真实数据集上的先进性能。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过动态时间分析显著提升了噪声标签下的学习效果，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 在跨数据集评估（Argoverse2训练，NuScenes测试）中验证了目标选择过程的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在新场景中的泛化性能。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Motivation: 现有联邦图学习（FGL）方法依赖同步通信，效率低且不实用；异步联邦学习（AFL）方法未考虑图数据拓扑特性，可能导致语义漂移和表示不一致。

Method: 提出FedSA-GCL框架，结合客户端标签分布差异和图拓扑特性，采用ClusterCast机制进行高效训练。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL在效率和鲁棒性上表现优异，为联邦图学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

TL;DR: 本文首次对六种基于线性规划的完全修正提升方法进行了大规模实验研究，包括两种新方法NM-Boost和QRLP-Boost，结果表明这些方法在浅树情况下可以媲美或优于XGBoost等先进方法，并能生成更稀疏的集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于线性规划的完全修正提升方法在理论上具有吸引力，但它们在实证研究中受到的关注有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究使用了六种基于线性规划的提升方法，包括两种新方法（NM-Boost和QRLP-Boost），并在20个多样化数据集上进行了实验。评估了启发式和最优基学习器的使用，分析了准确性、集成稀疏性、边际分布、实时性能和超参数敏感性。

Conclusion: 基于线性规划的完全修正提升方法在特定条件下具有显著优势，尤其是在稀疏性和性能平衡方面，但也存在使用最优决策树的局限性。

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

<details>

Motivation: 解决深度学习PPM方法因现实事件日志的低变异性和小规模而受限的问题。

Method: 提出三种基于控制流语义和频繁行为模式的统计增强方法，结合Siamese学习框架生成新轨迹变体。

Result: 在真实事件日志上表现优于现有方法，统计增强显著优于随机变换。

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM为流程预测中的数据增强提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在持续学习（CL）环境下，恶意软件检测模型的安全回归问题，并提出了一种回归感知的惩罚方法来减少这种有害变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件快速演变，传统机器学习检测器需不断适应，但全量数据重新训练不现实。持续学习虽能增量更新，但可能引发安全回归问题，即已检测到的恶意软件在新模型中被误判为无害，这对安全关键应用构成严重风险。

Method: 研究形式化并量化了安全回归问题，提出了一种回归感知的惩罚方法，并调整了Positive Congruent Training（PCT）以适应CL环境，以模型无关的方式保留先前的预测行为。

Result: 在ELSA、Tesseract和AZ-Class数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了不同CL场景下的回归，同时保持了长期的强检测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为持续学习在恶意软件检测中的应用提供了安全回归问题的解决方案，增强了模型更新的可信度。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电池健康监测对安全和效率至关重要，但现有模型难以处理不规则放电周期数据。

Method: 提出TIDSIT架构，结合连续时间嵌入和时间注意力机制，处理不规则和变长输入。

Result: 在NASA数据集上，TIDSIT显著优于现有模型，预测误差降低50%以上，SoH误差低于0.58%。

Conclusion: TIDSIT在电池健康监测中表现优异，且适用于其他不规则时间序列任务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前多智能体强化学习（MARL）的成功依赖于简单约定而非有效信号恢复，并呼吁设计更真实的测试环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前MARL算法在Dec-POMDP框架下的局限性，揭示其成功依赖于简单约定而非真正的环境推理。

Method: 通过案例研究分析智能体学习行为的脆弱性，并对比任务设计对学习策略的影响。

Result: 发现智能体容易学习脆弱的约定，而任务设计可以促使学习更稳健的策略。

Conclusion: 建议设计新的MARL环境，强调基于观察和记忆的推理，以测试真正的多智能体协作能力。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HyperDeepONets虽然提高了表达能力，但因其高内存和计算成本，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 引入PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets，利用LoRA将超网络的输出层权重矩阵分解为两个低秩矩阵，减少参数数量。

Result: 实验表明，PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets参数减少70%，预测精度和泛化能力优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets是一种高效且性能优越的算子学习架构。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Result: 实验表明，学生模型在单次前向传播中能达到与教师模型相当或更好的预测和不确定性量化性能。

Conclusion: 首次证明通过证据蒸馏可以在LLMs中实现高效且鲁棒的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

TL;DR: HYPER方法结合多模型集成和水库计算，提高了数据稀缺条件下的洪水预测准确性，同时保持高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多地区缺乏足够的河流流量观测数据，限制了降雨-径流分析的准确性，现有模型在数据稀缺条件下难以同时满足高精度、可解释性和计算效率。

Method: HYPER方法首先通过贝叶斯模型平均（BMA）集成43个未校准的概念水文模型，再利用水库计算（RC）通过线性回归校正BMA输出误差。对于无测站流域，通过关联测站流域属性推断BMA和RC权重。

Result: 在日本87个河流流域的测试中，HYPER在数据丰富场景下性能与LSTM相当（KGE 0.56 vs. 0.55），但计算时间仅为5%；在数据稀缺场景下（23%流域有测站），HYPER保持稳健性能（KGE 0.55），而LSTM性能显著下降（KGE -0.04）。

Conclusion: HYPER通过集成未校准模型和机器学习偏差校正，提供了一种高效、稳健且可推广的流量预测解决方案，尤其适用于无测站流域。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Conclusion: 改进的双模拟度量解决了传统方法的局限性，为强化学习任务提供了更有效的表示学习技术。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

Method: 使用Price方程对变化进行简单的符号划分，推导出力-度量-偏置（FMB）定律：Δθ = Mf + b + ξ。

Conclusion: FMB定律为跨学科的学习算法提供了一个统一的理论框架，有助于算法的理解和设计。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Result: 实验表明该方法易于实现，且性能优于非不变架构。

Conclusion: 该SE(2)不变变换器架构具有类似大语言模型的扩展优势，适用于自动驾驶任务。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Conclusion: 多级条件扩散模型和Protein-MMD为蛋白质设计提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Conclusion: Moving Out基准测试和BASS方法为物理环境中的人机协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny
Machine Learning (Tiny ML) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The
system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU
sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,
from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going
downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI
platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test
dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.
Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the
robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power
operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.
