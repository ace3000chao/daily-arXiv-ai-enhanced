Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the\nhippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes\nepisodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for\nreasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with\nRules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves\nsystematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting\nmodules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive\nneocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural\nDecomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a\ntask-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one\ndecomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the\nsequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC\n\"System 2\" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,\nstoring variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed.

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new\nmethodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive\nmarket making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic\ntrading in complex financial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u5e02\u573a\u505a\u5e02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u505a\u5e02\u5546\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5e93\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u76c8\u5229\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u505a\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MORL\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86POW-dTS\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u505a\u5e02\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u91d1\u878d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d8\u9769\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Not published anywhere else", "summary": "Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but\neffective policy learning under partial observability remains a major\nchallenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To\ndate, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with\nincomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4\nenvironment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as\npossible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving\nforward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact\nforces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under\npartial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,\ndespite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,\nthe policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in\nbody part masses.

Despite the\nsuccess of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not\nyet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data\nhas an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the\nobservation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology\n``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we\npropose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by\nretained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be\nintegrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is\nupper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both\nstructured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we\nfurther find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for\nassessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the\namount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we\ndevise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of\nun-pruning.

For instance, in healthcare\napplications, we might like to learn features that contain information about\npathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic\nvariability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable\nacross all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with\nAnti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement\nframework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)\ncharacteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during\ntraining, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift\nat test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be\nsemantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain\ninformation relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,\nwhich encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet\nmay degrade performance due to associations with content present in training\ndata that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,\nwhich we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the\nstyle attributes and content labels.

The conventional\nparadigm of data visualization practices for policy and decision-making is to\nconvey data in a supposedly neutral, objective manner for rational\ndecision-makers. Feminist critique advocates for nuanced and reflexive\napproaches that take into account situated decision-makers and their affective\nrelationships to data. This paper sheds light on a key cognitive aspect that\nimpacts how decision-makers interpret data. Because all outcomes from policies\nrelevant to climate change occur at a distance, decision-makers experience\nso-called `psychological distance' to environmental decisions in terms of\nspace, time, social identity, and hypotheticality. This profoundly impacts how\nthey perceive and evaluate outcomes. Since policy decisions to achieve a safe\nplanetary space are urgently needed for immediate transition and change, we\nneed a design practice that takes into account how psychological distance\naffects cognition and decision-making. Our paper explores the role of\nalternative design approaches in developing visualizations used for climate\npolicymaking. We conduct a literature review and synthesis which bridges\npsychological distance with speculative design and data visceralization by\nillustrating the value of affective design methods via examples from previous\nresearch.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs.

Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator", "comment": "19 pages, 2 figures. Accepted as a spotlight poster at ICML 2025", "summary": "The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the \"Fisher diagonal\")\nhas frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,\nthe Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's\nlikelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or\nthousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At\nthe same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer\ncompute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.\nThis paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal\ncan be obtained \"for free\" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that\nhas already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive\nset of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we\ndemonstrate that the \"Squisher\" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an\napproximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher\ndiagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the\nexact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide\nempirical quantification of their respective impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cSquisher\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5df2\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u52a0\u5668\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3cFisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1Fisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Fisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Adam\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5df2\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u65b9\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5df2\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8fd1\u4f3cFisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201cSquisher\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u590d\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5df2\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u68af\u5ea6\u7d2f\u52a0\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3aFisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "Squisher\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0eFisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u91cf\u5316\u4e86Squisher\u4e0eFisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "Squisher\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Fisher\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

There are\nstrong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned\nreinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a\nlarge number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each\ntest episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that\nperformance can be substantially improved through test-time training,\nspecializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time\noffline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead\nto substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel\nself-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an\noffline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality\nwith respect to the evaluation goal.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for\nclinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to\npredict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early\nclinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was\ncurated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical\nfeatures-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were\nselected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several\nmodels were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;\nCatBoost demonstrated the best performance.

Conventional\ndesign flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are\nlimited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this\npaper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the\nautomatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically\nmultipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis\noptimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.\nNotably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%\nswitching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads\ncompared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite\nState Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of\nlogic functions.

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

As mass spectrometers will be\ncentral to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from\ntheir data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential\nfor unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be\ninterpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular\nassembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been\nproduced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for\nlife detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as\nbuilding blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.\nSecond, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be\nphysically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from\nother approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular\ncomplexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass\nspectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address\nthis, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly\nwith high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.\nSimulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double\nmodel error, emphasizing the need for standardization.

Afterwards, multiple\nsubclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which\nidentifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the\nredundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of\noverall embedding.

A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet\nvelocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training\nand testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts\ntwo-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training\nand testing datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CBML\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u5ba4\u5185\u6c14\u6d41\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u6216\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1aCAER\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u573a\u7279\u5f81\uff0cMLP\u6620\u5c04\u5165\u53e3\u901f\u5ea6\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0cCNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u5165\u53e3\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u53cc\u5165\u53e3\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "CBML\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u53cc\u5165\u53e3\u573a\u666f\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "CBML\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5ba4\u5185\u6c14\u6d41\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While\nempirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple\nobjective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work\nintroduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to\ndeconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the\nsingle-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category\nStoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,\nallows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes\nthree main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic\nrationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,\nquantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods\nexploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn\nnot just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a\nprocess we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.

As a result, established platforms in other\ndomains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to\nengage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of\nthese experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI\ninnovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms\nactively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new\nchallenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video\nexperience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences\nintroduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when\noptimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos.

In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map\nreconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse\nsampling.

The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed\napproach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic\nsystemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents\na fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a\ndynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain\nevent logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential\nTime-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through\nthe Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that\nmeasures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This\ncombined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an\nLP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used\nby existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables\nSILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by\ntraditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective\noracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing\nDeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the\nunderlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the\ncommon false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in\ntraditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for\nproactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their\necosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "SILS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\uff08LPs\uff09\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u540d\u4e49\u8d44\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u8868\u9762\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u94fe\u4e0a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u6267\u884c\u75d5\u8ff9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff08ETWL\uff09\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\uff08LSIS\uff09\u3002", "result": "SILS\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529bLPs\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u6f0f\u62a5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "SILS\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347DeFi\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}
