Whether interactions\nbetween AI agents can replicate the synergy observed in human discussions\nremains an open question. To investigate this, we systematically compared four\nconversational configurations: pairs of large language models (LLM-LLM), trios\nof LLMs, trios of humans, and mixed human-LLM pairs. After agents answered\nquestions individually, they engaged in open-ended discussions and then\nreconsidered their initial answers. Interactions involving humans consistently\nled to accuracy improvements after the conversations, benefiting both stronger\nand weaker participants. By contrast, purely LLM-based pairs and trios\nexhibited declines in accuracy, demonstrating limited conversational synergy.\nAnalysis of participants' confidence and answer-switching behavior revealed\nthat knowledge diversity is a critical factor enabling collaborative\nimprovement. Crucially, the lack of gains in LLM-LLM interactions did not stem\nfrom a fundamental limitation of the models' ability to collaborate, but from\nhighly similar knowledge states that left little room for productive exchange.\nOur findings argue for a paradigm shift in AI development: rather than\noptimizing individual models solely for standalone performance, explicitly\ncultivating diversity across agents, even at the cost of slightly lower\nindividual accuracy, may yield AI collaborators that are more effective in\ngroup settings with humans or other AI systems."}

In our experiments, we utilize\nmeteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United\nStates (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our\nframework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,\nfrost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.\nThe framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a\nrecurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal\nexplanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but\nprecisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive\naccuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's\ncapacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research\nsignificantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard\nEWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process\nfor climate risk management in the agricultural industry."}

We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event\n(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their\nregistrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107\ntwo-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with\nstructured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier\npredicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model\nto predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;\nRMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,\nClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream\nmodel for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts\nexceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was\ndeveloped for embedding extraction. Results: The best model\n(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a\nhigher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of\nparticipants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE\nof 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without\nit. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across\n12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%.

Weight and activation quantization\n(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and\narithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ\ndesigns. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization\nfor hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform\nquantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like\ndistributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform\nnature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring\ndequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during\ninference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.\nOffline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant\nmodel performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques\nintroduce substantial runtime overhead.\n  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of\nWAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose\nKLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based\ncomputation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations\non K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and\nfull-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier\ndetection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and\nsmallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.\n  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,\n7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the\nA100 GPU and Atom, respectively."}

The model supports both structured\nand unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of\ntextual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and\nsolver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation\nacross simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The\ntrained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,\nincluding time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting\nto combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to\nunseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single\nsample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results\nshow that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,\noffering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows."}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

These channels enable the anonymous trade of\nillicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and\ncategorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the\nevolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online\nsources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or\ncredential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source\ncorpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,\nincluding BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

With flexible\nfew-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based\ninterpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented\nopportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a\nnovel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts\nTableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for\nbusiness intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data\nwith small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using\nin-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes\nTableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary\nclassification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework\nharnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the\nencoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose\nLLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks.

As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By\nuniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR\noffers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including\nchemical library-driven scenarios.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second\nchallenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and\nspatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to\nseparate constraint complexity from search space expansion.

This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we\nincorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded\npatterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which\ncomplement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random\nForest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related\ndocuments. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or\ncredential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source\ncorpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,\nincluding BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird.

While they exhibit strong\nzero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related\napplications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of\nmusic-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we\npropose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question\nanswering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to\nLLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to\nquestions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a\nmusic-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes\ncontext information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to\neffectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our\nexperiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional\nfine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,\nshowing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA\nbenchmarks.

Accurately predicting patient\nenrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges\nduring the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based\nmethod to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural\nnetwork model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the\ncomplexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into\nexpressive representations.

We propose a method for active model selection, using\npredictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data\npoints that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,\nperforms consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships\nbetween classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic\nframework.
