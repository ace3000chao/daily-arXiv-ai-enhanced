The first notation is the sketching rules for an existing UI sketch\ndataset, and the second notation is the set of sketches generated by\nparticipants in this study, where individuals sketched UIs without imposed\nrepresentational rules. We imagine two systems, FixedSketch and FlexiSketch,\nbuilt with each notation respectively, in order to understand the differential\naffordances of, and potential design requirements for, systems.

EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as\na multi-round adversarial game.

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of\nnumerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros\nminimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as\nVariational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\napproaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population\nsynthesis.

This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable\nboth dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and\ntruly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight\ncontroller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate\nDQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on\nImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1\naccuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,\n76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this\nwith a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a\ndrastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)\nfloating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a\nnew frontier in efficient, adaptive AI."}

However, the lack of unified\nevaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these\nparadigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a\nmulti-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive\nevaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major\nalignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:\nalignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and\nrobustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment\nstrategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying\nstrengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing\nvaluable insights for future research directions."}

This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection.

In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks\nrandomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We\npropose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology\nby progressively removing low-importance connections during training.\nIntegrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our\napproach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and\napplies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed\nintervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while\nmaintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate\npruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting\nmodels including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four\ndatasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with\nstatistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).\nIn financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over\nmodels with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.\nThis dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight\nelimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into\ndiverse architectures.

This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance.

AI was\nhighly consistent with humans for concrete, explicitly stated questions (e.g.,\ntitle, aims) and lower for questions requiring subjective interpretation or\nabsent in text (e.g., Kirkpatrick's outcomes, study rationale). Human-human\nconsistency was not higher than AI-human and showed the same question-dependent\nvariability. Discordant AI-human responses (769/3179 = 24.2%) were mostly due\nto interpretive differences (18.3%); AI inaccuracies were rare (1.51%), while\nhumans were nearly three times more likely to state inaccuracies (4.37%).\nFindings suggest AI accuracy depends more on interpretability than\nhallucination.

Using quantile regression, we model the relationship\nbetween the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective\ndistance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the\nmodel, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial\nDependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The\nfindings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,\nspecific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the\nangle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key\nfactor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater\nthan 169{\\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for\nfemale athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the\nmost critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.\nThis study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features\non athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events."}
