### [1] [Clinically Grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation: An Interpretable Metric for Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02808)
*Radhika Dua,Young Joon,Kwon,Siddhant Dogra,Daniel Freedman,Diana Ruan,Motaz Nashawaty,Danielle Rigau,Daniel Alexander Alber,Kang Zhang,Kyunghyun Cho,Eric Karl Oermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICARE是一个基于大型语言模型代理的动态多选问答框架，用于评估放射学报告生成的临床可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标缺乏临床可解释性，ICARE旨在提供透明且临床相关的报告评估方法。

Method: 利用两个代理（分别基于真实报告和生成报告）生成临床问题并相互测试，通过答案一致性评估临床精确度和召回率。

Result: ICARE与专家判断更一致，对临床内容敏感且可重复，能揭示可解释的错误模式。

Conclusion: ICARE为放射学报告生成提供了一种透明、可解释且临床相关的评估框架。

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and
clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred
interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment
requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics
often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking
interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded
Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework
leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question
answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated
report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement
on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as
interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to
question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment.
Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment
than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical
content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error
patterns.

### [2] [Modeling Annotator Disagreement with Demographic-Aware Experts and Synthetic Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02853)
*Yinuo Xu,Veronica Derricks,Allison Earl,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过架构和数据创新建模NLP任务中标注者分歧的方法DEM-MoE，利用标注者人口统计信息路由输入到专家子网络，表现优异，尤其在分歧高的数据上。还探索了使用LLM生成合成标注填补数据稀疏性，并提出了混合真实与合成数据的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观NLP任务中标注者分歧的建模问题，尤其是在人口统计群体间的结构化差异。

Method: 提出DEM-MoE模型，基于标注者人口统计信息路由输入到专家子网络；使用LLM生成合成标注填补数据稀疏性；提出混合真实与合成数据的策略。

Result: DEM-MoE在人口统计群体间表现优异，尤其在分歧高的数据上；LLM生成的合成标注与人类标注中度一致；混合策略效果取决于数据集结构。

Conclusion: DEM-MoE和合成数据策略能更好地表示多样视角，提升模型性能。

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP
tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model,
DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert
subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent
structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE
consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows
especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To
address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic
annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We
show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on
our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then
propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using
strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies
depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the
representation of diverse perspectives.

### [3] [Highlight & Summarize: RAG without the jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02872)
*Giovanni Cherubin,Andrew Paverd*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Highlight & Summarize（H&S）的新设计模式，用于防止大型语言模型（LLMs）的越狱和劫持攻击。该方法通过将检索增强生成（RAG）流程分为高亮和总结两部分，避免直接暴露用户问题给生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防止恶意用户通过精心设计的提示绕过LLMs的安全措施，生成不良内容或偏离预期任务。现有方法依赖概率性防御，易被绕过。

Method: 提出H&S设计模式，将RAG流程分为高亮器（提取相关段落）和总结器（生成连贯回答），避免直接暴露用户问题。

Result: 使用基于LLM的高亮器时，H&S生成的回答在正确性、相关性和质量上优于标准RAG流程。

Conclusion: H&S通过设计防止攻击，同时提升回答质量，为LLMs的安全应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs)
is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a
chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM
to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its
intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on
hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to
detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these
probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large
space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and
evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by
design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline
(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant
sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This
is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which
takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from
the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages
and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible
instantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of
correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an
LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better
than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

### [4] [Merge-based syntax is mediated by distinct neurocognitive mechanisms: A clustering analysis of comprehension abilities in 84,000 individuals with language deficits across nine languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02885)
*Elliot Murphy,Rohan Venkatesh,Edward Khokhlovich,Andrey Vyshedskiy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了句法操作'Merge'的复杂性，发现其可能由不同认知机制支持，并揭示了三种不同的结构类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索'Merge'作为句法核心操作的神经认知基础，以及其在语言处理中的多样性。

Method: 通过系统研究参与者对句法复杂度递增句子的理解，进行聚类分析。

Result: 行为学证据揭示了三种不同的结构类型，可能与不同发展阶段和选择性损伤相关。

Conclusion: 'Merge'可能在进化中突然出现，但不同类型的Merge对象由不同认知机制支持。

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax,
'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g.,
'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase).
This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on
this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract
grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an
elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step.
From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge
may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions
(e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and
(3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa").
Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences
with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed
behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as
potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective
impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in
evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species
took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of
various types of Merge-based objects.

### [5] [Coherent Multimodal Reasoning with Iterative Self-Evaluation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02886)
*Wenjie Luo,Ruocheng Li,Shanshan Zhu,Julian Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CMRF的新框架，通过迭代自评估推理机制提升多模态模型的常识推理能力，并在多个基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在复杂多模态推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏深思熟虑的推理能力，因此需要一种新方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: CMRF框架包含三个关键模块：RDU分解问题、CIE进行上下文推理、CAM评估逻辑一致性，并结合自适应迭代优化策略。

Result: CMRF在多个基准测试中平均准确率达到69.4%，超过最佳开源基线2.4个百分点，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: CMRF通过模块化设计和迭代优化显著提升了多模态模型的推理能力，实验和人工评估验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step,
cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of
"deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather
than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information
with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal
Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense
reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference
mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,
generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework
integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking
down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for
contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating
logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative
Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built
upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning
(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It
attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline
by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning
scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the
critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative
refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

*Osama Khalid,Sanvesh Srivastava,Padmini Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了感官语言与传统风格特征的关系，使用R4方法发现低维LIWC特征能有效预测感官语言，并提出SLIM-LLMs模型，性能接近全规模模型但参数减少80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感官语言与传统风格特征的关系，以改进语言模型的效率和解释性。

Method: 采用Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4)方法，提取低维LIWC特征，并开发SLIM-LLMs模型。

Result: 低维LIWC特征（r=24）与全特征集（r=74）效果相当，SLIM-LLMs在五种文体中性能接近全规模模型，参数减少80%。

Conclusion: 低维风格特征和SLIM-LLMs模型为高效且可解释的语言建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision,
sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how
we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between
sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by
LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate
that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively
capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the
full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable
Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style
dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features
match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters
by up to 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话生成中的挑战，如话题连贯性、知识进展、角色一致性和控制粒度。

Method: 探索了六个维度中的九个关键参数，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 参数化控制显著影响了生成的对话属性。

Conclusion: 该框架为对话质量控制提供了标准化方法，未来将扩展参数和开发评估数据集。

Abstract: This paper introduces a parameterization framework for controlling
conversation quality in large language models. We explore nine key parameters
across six dimensions that enable precise specification of dialogue properties.
Through experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that
parameter-based control produces statistically significant differences in
generated conversation properties. Our approach addresses challenges in
conversation generation, including topic coherence, knowledge progression,
character consistency, and control granularity. The framework provides a
standardized method for conversation quality control with applications in
education, therapy, customer service, and entertainment. Future work will focus
on implementing additional parameters through architectural modifications and
developing benchmark datasets for evaluation.

### [8] [CoCoTen: Detecting Adversarial Inputs to Large Language Models through Latent Space Features of Contextual Co-occurrence Tensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02997)
*Sri Durga Sai Sowmya Kadali,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文共现矩阵和张量的新方法，用于高效检测对抗性和越狱提示，显著提升了检测性能和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用使其易受攻击，尤其是越狱攻击，因此需要开发强大的检测方法以确保其安全可靠使用。

Method: 利用上下文共现矩阵和张量的潜在空间特性，提出了一种新颖的检测方法。

Result: 该方法在仅使用0.5%标记提示的情况下，F1分数达到0.83，比基线提高了96.6%，且速度提升了2.3至128.4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺环境下表现出色，为LLMs的安全使用提供了有效解决方案，并公开了实现以支持未来研究。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks
a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and
hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially
jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,
developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use
of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual
Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce
environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space
characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the
effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations
show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of
labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result
highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data
is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to
128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and
reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

### [9] [When Algorithms Meet Artists: Topic Modeling the AI-Art Debate, 2013-2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03037)
*Ariya Mukherjee-Gandhi,Oliver Muellerklein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2013至2025年关于AI生成艺术的英文讨论，揭示了艺术家观点与主流叙事的不一致，并指出技术术语可能成为排斥艺术家声音的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI对艺术创作的影响，以及艺术家在相关讨论中的边缘化问题。

Method: 基于439份500字的文本摘录，采用可重复的方法论（BERTopic）识别出五个稳定的主题集群。

Result: 发现艺术家关注的问题与媒体叙事存在偏差，技术术语可能阻碍艺术家参与讨论。

Conclusion: 呼吁在AI与创意领域的讨论中更透明地纳入艺术家视角，并提供了一种方法论和多模态基线供未来研究参考。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes
of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have
raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative
labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public
and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013
to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws
from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports,
blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible
methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a
misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our
findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle
form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent.
Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for
future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven
engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

### [10] [Privacy-Aware Decoding: Mitigating Privacy Leakage of Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03098)
*Haoran Wang,Xiongxiao Xu,Baixiang Huang,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAD提出了一种轻量级的隐私保护解码方法，通过在生成时注入噪声来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因检索敏感数据而导致的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 采用自适应高斯噪声注入、基于置信度的筛选和上下文感知噪声校准。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上显著减少隐私泄露，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: PAD为敏感领域的RAG系统提供了一种通用且可扩展的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources.
However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are
susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information
through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a
lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian
noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based
screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity
estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration
to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP)
accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit
per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs.
Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is
model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving
response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based
defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in
RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy
solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available:

*Zizhong Li,Haopeng Zhang,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对检索增强生成（RAG）系统的新型攻击框架TPARAG，通过轻量级白盒LLM生成和优化恶意内容，显著提高了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG框架提升了LLM的准确性和实时性，但其引入的外部知识库带来了新的安全漏洞，现有攻击方法在效果和适用性上存在局限。

Method: 提出TPARAG框架，利用轻量级白盒LLM在token级别生成和优化恶意内容，同时针对检索和生成阶段进行攻击。

Result: 实验表明TPARAG在检索阶段和端到端攻击效果上优于现有方法，揭示了RAG系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: TPARAG不仅提升了攻击效果，还为改进RAG系统的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face
critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address
these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs
with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and
real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new
security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external
database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior
work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely
heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval
and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack
on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and
black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an
attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token
level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.
Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG
consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end
attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in
RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

### [12] [Cross-lingual Opinions and Emotions Mining in Comparable Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03112)
*Motaz Saad,David Langlois,Kamel Smaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了英语-阿拉伯语可比文本中情感和情绪的差异，提出了一种跨语言标注方法，并发现情感标注的相似性与新闻来源相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同语言中同一话题的情感表达差异，填补现有文献中未探索的跨语言情感比较空白。

Method: 通过人工翻译情感词典创建双语情感标注工具，避免依赖机器翻译，并应用统计方法评估情感标注的一致性。

Result: 结果显示，来自同一新闻机构的情感标注更一致，而不同来源的标注差异较大。

Conclusion: 该方法具有语言独立性，可推广至其他语言对，为跨语言情感分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are
not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is
discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and
emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated
with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label
documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on
machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy,
sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA)
lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the
comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement
of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison
is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To
our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study
includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera
(JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles
come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones.
The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language
pairs.

Result: 相比现有方法，能生成更高质量的长故事。

Conclusion: 多智能体结构和记忆存储模型有效解决了主题漂移和逻辑问题，提升了故事生成的质量和吸引力。

Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a
sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has
addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a
multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach
suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the
loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic
that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to
improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core
components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model
comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most
important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory
storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To
incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle
framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain
factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates
the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by
building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we
establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction
through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it
remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods
demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

TL;DR: RCP-Merging框架通过将推理能力作为先验，高效合并领域专用模型与长链推理模型，提升领域任务性能，同时保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有合并方法在融合领域专用模型与长链推理模型时导致的推理能力退化问题。

Method: 提出RCP-Merging框架，以推理模型权重为先验，通过推理能力指标选择性合并领域权重。

Result: 在BioMedicine和Finance领域实验中，领域任务性能提升9.5%和9.2%，且推理能力未显著受损。

Conclusion: RCP-Merging是一种高效的模型合并方法，适用于需要同时具备领域知识和长链推理能力的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability,
termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving
abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability
model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without
substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly
resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer
from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output
collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long
Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning
Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate
domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model
performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as
foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to
preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging
essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on
Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance
domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning
model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and
9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original
long CoT reasoning capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决LLMs在复杂指令下表现不一致的框架，通过预览和自检机制提升推理能力，实验证明其显著优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂指令下的表现不一致，主要原因是推理阶段的懒惰行为，需要一种方法来提升其严格遵循指令的能力。

Method: 生成复杂约束的指令并过滤，构建数据集；采用拒绝采样和熵保持的微调策略，结合基于规则的强化学习。

Result: Light-IF-32B模型在指令遵循任务上表现优异，超越多个开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，尤其在复杂指令下的表现，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly
enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and
general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions
remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our
investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the
primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this
issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous
reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for
satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate
instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain
valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,
easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to
curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization
of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.
Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning
(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)
reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach
encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering
generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.
Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate
remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our
Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1
and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析德国联邦议院近五年的28,000篇议会演讲，开发了主题和情感分类的机器学习模型，揭示了政党间的关系及其在议会中的角色变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨德国联邦议院中政治话语的演变，特别是政党从执政党转为反对党时的风格变化，以及意识形态与执政责任对话语的影响。

Method: 开发并训练了两个机器学习模型（主题分类和情感分类），基于手动标注的数据集，评估了模型的分类性能（AUROC分别为0.94和0.89）。

Result: 模型表现出色，揭示了政党间的关系及其角色变化，特别是执政党转为反对党时的风格变化。

Conclusion: 研究直接回答了关于主题演变、情感动态和政党特定话语策略的关键问题，表明意识形态和执政责任共同塑造了议会话语。

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the
Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the
last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment
classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The
models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic
classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification.
Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions
across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable
relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a
change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to
opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also
shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the
evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse
strategies in the Bundestag.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语法性别如何影响文本到图像（T2I）模型中的视觉表现，发现语法性别标记显著影响性别表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口统计和刻板印象，忽略了语法性别对视觉表现的影响。

Method: 引入跨语言基准数据集，涵盖五种性别化语言和两种中性语言，生成28,800张图像进行分析。

Result: 语法性别显著影响图像生成，男性标记使男性表征增至73%，女性标记使女性表征增至38%。

Conclusion: 语言结构本身（不仅是内容）影响AI生成的视觉输出，为理解多语言、多模态系统中的偏见提供了新维度。

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on
demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a
fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual
representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark
examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender
associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but
referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset
spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and
two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique
prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models.
Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image
generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\%
on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine
grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in
English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability
and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects.
Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes
AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias
and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私是基本人权，但大语言模型需要大量数据，其中可能包含私人信息，需保护。

Method: 研究了几种预处理方法，用于在文本数据中掩码或伪匿名化私人信息。

Result: 提出了适用于领域无关NLP任务的匿名化方法。

Conclusion: 虽然完全匿名化可能不可行，但预处理技术可以有效保护隐私。

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different
regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge
amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains
private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private
information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and
sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may
not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for
masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report
focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

Motivation: 探究结构探针在揭示句法结构时是否受结构和统计因素的系统性影响。

Result: 结构探针受词距和语言特性影响，但对单词预测性不敏感。

Conclusion: 揭示了结构探针的局限性，并提供了受控基准以改进评估。

Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the
activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes''
that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on
an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether
structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic
representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold.
First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two
words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them
as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic
properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered
by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do
not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall,
this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康应用中难以复现西方和东方抑郁症状的文化差异，尤其是在英语提示下。使用东方语言提示时部分改善，但模型对文化角色的低敏感性和症状层级的主导性限制了其文化适应性。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能复现西方和东方抑郁症状的文化差异，评估其在心理健康应用中的文化适应性。

Method: 通过使用西方或东方角色提示LLMs，分析其在英语和东方语言（中文、日语、印地语）中的反应模式。

Result: LLMs在英语提示下未能复现文化差异，但在东方语言提示下部分改善。模型对文化角色的低敏感性和症状层级的主导性是主要原因。

Conclusion: 当前通用LLMs缺乏文化感知能力，提示语言虽重要，但不足以支持安全和有效的心理健康应用。

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with
depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals
report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by
prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely
fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in
major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment
in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this
failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,
culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These
findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current
general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for
safe and effective mental health applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治辩论的复杂性和隐含性使得通用语言模型难以有效分析，需要专门针对政治领域的语言模型。

Method: 在大型政治辩论语料库上预训练RooseBERT，并在四项下游任务（命名实体识别、情感分析、论据检测与分类、论据关系预测与分类）上进行微调。

Result: RooseBERT在四项任务中显著优于通用语言模型，证明了领域特定预训练的有效性。

Conclusion: 领域特定预训练能显著提升政治辩论分析任务的性能，RooseBERT为研究社区提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions
calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically
analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political
deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language
and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication
strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging,
even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse
language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised
domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring
extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been
trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed
of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its
performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political
debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument
component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and
classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over
general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how
domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis.
We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNER方法过度依赖知识蒸馏（KD）导致模型稳定性过强而可塑性不足，无法有效平衡新旧知识。

Method: 从表示视角引入池化操作增强可塑性，从权重视角动态合并新旧模型权重，并采用权重引导的选择机制和基于置信度的伪标签方法处理非实体类型的语义偏移。

Result: 在三个基准数据集的十种CNER设置中，SPT方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPT方法有效实现了稳定性与可塑性的平衡，解决了CNER中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses
on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types.
Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve
prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that
the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they
often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old
knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To
address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method
for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight
perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling
operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by
consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we
dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old
knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a
weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,
we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current
non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the
semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has
largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER
settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses
previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a
suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

Motivation: 现有研究多依赖虚构角色，本研究填补了使用真实人类数据评估LLMs模拟经济行为能力的空白。

Method: 通过522名韩国参与者的文化消费场景数据，系统比较了三种多模态LLMs的表现，并探讨了角色注入方法的影响。

Result: LLMs在个体层面预测不准确，但能合理反映群体行为趋势；常见提示技术未显著优于简单方法。

Conclusion: 研究为计算社会科学中基于角色的模拟提供了实证指导，首次全面评估了LLMs使用真实数据模拟经济行为的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant
interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies
rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this
limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic
decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real
522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art
multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants
in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately
replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect
prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise
individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level
behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting
techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of
personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain
against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the
first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic
behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based
simulation in computational social science.

Motivation: 现有间隔重复算法在语义干扰和个性化适应方面表现不足，特别是在语言考试等高成功率需求的场景中。

Method: LECTOR结合大型语言模型的语义相似性评估和间隔重复原则，设计了一种自适应调度算法。

Result: 在100天的模拟学习中，LECTOR的成功率达到90.2%，优于最佳基线算法（88.4%），尤其在处理语义相似概念时表现突出。

Conclusion: LECTOR为智能辅导系统和自适应学习平台提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory
retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference
and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced
\textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a
novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented
learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is
paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while
incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge
of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic
similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition
principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms
(SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over
100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\%
success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a
2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling
semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while
maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a
promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning
platforms.

Result: 模型显著趋同于对话风格，但存在过拟合现象；指令调优和更大模型趋同程度较低。

Conclusion: 模型与人类的趋同机制可能不同，需进一步研究其底层行为差异。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in
generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans
remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic
convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking:
do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To
answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues
to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue
corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly
converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative
to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific,
we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with
instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained
counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence
patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are
very different.

Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，其可能放大性别偏见的问题引起关注，但现有研究多关注显性偏见，忽略了生成内容中的隐性偏见。

Method: 使用心理学中的性别刻板印象（如攻击性或八卦）在开放式叙事生成任务中评估偏见，并引入新数据集StereoBias-Stories。

Result: 发现模型在无条件提示下偏向男性，非性别属性可缓解偏见；多属性组合会强化刻板印象；模型偏见与心理学分类一致且随模型规模增加。

Conclusion: 强调了基于心理学评估LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different
applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in
various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using
explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion
and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit
forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,
we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in
psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of
narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories
containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or
six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related
story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story
changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)
While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned
prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes
mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same
gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias
and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological
ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with
model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of
psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good
exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various
Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to
estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False
exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our
results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between
easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking
Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using
uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning
setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning
using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of
exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

Result: 实验和实际部署表明Hi-Guard在分类准确性、泛化性和可解释性上表现优异。

Conclusion: Hi-Guard为可扩展、透明且可信的内容安全系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also
accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To
ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond
efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches
largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation
rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we
propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that
introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical"
reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation
pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a
stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical
taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based
classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained
levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard
directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further
enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level
soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation
quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that
Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and
interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy
content safety systems. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单代理测试时间缩放（STTS）方法受限于单代理能力，而集体代理方法能突破单代理上限，因此探索集体测试时间缩放（CTTS）的潜力。

Method: 设计了三种CTTS范式（SA-MR、MA-SR、MA-MR），提出CTTS-MM框架，包括代理协作搜索（ACS）和混合奖励模型（MoR）。

Result: MA-MR范式表现最优，CTTS-MM在七个主流基准测试中均取得卓越性能。

Conclusion: CTTS-MM通过多代理和多奖励模型的协作显著提升了LLM的推理能力，代码将开源。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for
enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra
training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and
Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model
(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling
(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that
collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent
systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first
step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the
different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three
primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent
to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model
(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.
Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively
leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced
inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent
Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination
of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model
collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a
curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to
select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking
(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that
the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP方法（如NER和POS标记）未针对构建角色社交网络优化，且在低资源语言（如葡萄牙语）中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Taggus管道，结合POS标记和启发式方法，用于角色识别和交互检测。

Result: Taggus在角色识别任务中F1分数为94.1%，交互检测为75.9%，分别比现有工具提高50.7%和22.3%。

Conclusion: Taggus在葡萄牙语文学作品中表现优异，未来可改进角色关系检测。管道已公开以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction
books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage
multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity
Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are
not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of
Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform,
especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated
data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to
extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results
show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf
NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which
uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results
with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and
solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These
represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results
achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to
improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships
between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples
are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage
development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

### [32] [Thinking with Nothinking Calibration: A New In-Context Learning Paradigm in Reasoning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03363)
*Haotian Wu,Bo Xu,Yao Shu,Menglin Yang,Chengwei Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的上下文学习范式JointThinking，通过结合Thinking和Nothinking两种推理模式来提高推理准确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在上下文学习中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用JointThinking方法，并行生成Thinking和Nothinking模式的答案，仅在结果不一致时触发第二轮推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，优于少样本链式思维和多数投票方法，且在分布外任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: JointThinking展示了通过结构多样性提升推理性能的潜力，并具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research
has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,
their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To
fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),
a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two
reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.
Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:
one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of
Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,
using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both
candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\%
in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,
resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms
few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer
robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to
training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on
out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the
calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes
consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural
thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between
actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round
of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we
discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL
research in RLLMs.

### [33] [ReDSM5: A Reddit Dataset for DSM-5 Depression Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03399)
*Eliseo Bao,Anxo Pérez,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ReDSM5数据集，通过Reddit帖子标注DSM-5抑郁症状，提升抑郁检测的临床相关性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抑郁检测方法缺乏与DSM-5标准的关联，临床意义和可解释性不足。

Method: 构建ReDSM5数据集，包含1484篇Reddit帖子，由心理学家逐句标注DSM-5症状并提供临床解释。

Result: 数据集支持症状分类和解释生成，为未来研究提供基准。

Conclusion: ReDSM5结合症状标注和专家解释，推动抑郁检测模型的发展。

Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of
millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to
barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media
platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that
can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing
computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not
depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the
standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both
clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each
exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the
nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a
concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an
exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and
emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media
narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines
symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the
development of models that not only detect depression but also generate
human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both
multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing
reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Yiming Wang,Changchun Li,Jiaxu Cui,Renchu Guan,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态检测虚假信息的新框架MISDER，通过捕捉社交环境的动态变化来提高检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息在社交媒体上的传播危害巨大，但现有静态检测方法无法适应动态变化的社交环境。

Method: MISDER框架通过动态学习社交环境表示，并结合LSTM、连续动态方程和预训练动态系统三种变体进行预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，MISDER在两种流行数据集上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MISDER框架有效解决了虚假信息检测中的动态环境问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has
drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due
to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing
misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an
increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a
static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,
and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.
However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world
scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically
evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental
Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social
environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to
predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the
temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained
dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,
MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,
we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the
experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

*Junhong Wu,Jinliang Lu,Zixuan Ren,Ganqiang Hu,Zhi Wu,Dai Dai,Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的‘软思考’能力，发现其依赖软输入中最具影响力的部分，限制了多样化推理路径的探索。通过引入随机性（如Dirichlet重采样和Gumbel-Softmax技巧），实验表明可以缓解这一限制并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类认知擅长处理抽象和流动概念，而现有推理模型依赖离散标记，限制了表达能力。研究旨在通过软标记提升LLMs在连续概念空间中的推理能力。

Method: 使用探测技术分析LLMs的内部行为，发现软思考的局限性后，探索了Dirichlet重采样和Gumbel-Softmax技巧等随机性引入方法。

Result: 实验表明，引入随机性（尤其是Gumbel-Softmax技巧）能有效缓解软思考的局限性，并在八个推理基准中表现优异。

Conclusion: 随机性策略（如Gumbel-Softmax）能释放软思考的潜力，提升LLMs在连续概念空间中的推理能力。

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas
existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially
constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address
this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,
abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.
This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by
examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.
Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous
exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs
predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during
subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different
reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,
obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.
To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce
\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness
can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential
of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate
randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across
eight reasoning benchmarks.

*Rita González-Márquez,Philipp Berens,Dmitry Kobak*

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种文本嵌入增强策略，发现裁剪增强优于基于dropout的方法，自监督微调在领域内数据上表现接近监督SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督训练在文本嵌入中的应用，以弥补与计算机视觉领域的差距。

Method: 系统比较裁剪增强和dropout增强策略，评估嵌入质量。

Result: 裁剪增强表现更优，领域内数据接近监督SOTA，领域外数据表现较差。

Conclusion: 自监督微调在领域内数据上高效，且仅微调最后几层即可达到类似质量。

Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an
important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented
generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts
for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived
from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using
curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised
training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here
we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for
positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess
embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that
cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find
that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the
supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning
produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes
only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation
quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the
largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers
is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出CarbonPDF-QA数据集和CarbonPDF技术，用于解决PDF格式的可持续性报告中碳足迹问题回答的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDF格式的可持续性报告缺乏标准化，文本解析后结构不一致，导致信息提取困难。

Method: 开发CarbonPDF-QA数据集，并基于Llama 3微调提出CarbonPDF技术。

Result: CarbonPDF在回答碳足迹问题上优于现有技术，包括基于表格和文本数据的QA系统。

Conclusion: CarbonPDF为解决非结构化PDF报告中的碳足迹问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the
environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format.
These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates
their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting
formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting
relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle
the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within
sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our
focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and
inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this
analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing
question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with
human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer
questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose
CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon
footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama
3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms
current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems
finetuned on table and text data.

TL;DR: UPLME是一种不确定性感知的概率语言建模框架，用于解决回归任务中标签噪声问题，在共情检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习在共情回归任务中面临自报告共情分数的噪声问题，而回归任务中的噪声标签处理方法相对较少。

Method: UPLME结合概率语言模型和贝叶斯变分模型集成，预测共情分数和异方差不确定性，并引入两种新的损失函数。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，UPLME取得了最佳性能（Pearson相关系数提升），并能有效区分噪声和干净样本。

Conclusion: UPLME在共情检测任务中表现出色，优于现有方法，尤其在处理标签噪声和不确定性量化方面。

Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy
self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for
learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression
counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an
uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label
noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a
probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and
heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with
variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:
one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces
the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME
provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
$0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the
performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label
noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective
in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME
further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent
variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

*Lester James V. Miranda,Elyanah Aco,Conner Manuel,Jan Christian Blaise Cruz,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FilBench是一个针对菲律宾语言的基准测试，用于评估LLM在菲律宾语、他加禄语和宿务语中的表现。研究发现，即使是表现最好的模型（如GPT-4o）得分也仅为72.23%，表明该基准具有挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在英语任务中表现优异，但对其在菲律宾语言中的能力知之甚少。FilBench旨在填补这一空白，推动菲律宾语言的NLP研究。

Method: 通过设计FilBench基准，涵盖文化知识、传统NLP、阅读理解和生成等任务，评估27种最先进的LLM。

Result: LLM在阅读理解和翻译任务上表现不佳，即使是针对东南亚语言训练的模型（如SEA-LION v3 70B）得分也较低（61.07%）。

Conclusion: FilBench证明了语言特定基准的价值，有助于推动菲律宾语言的NLP研究并提高其在LLM开发中的包容性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is
known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this
work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in
Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to
reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as
Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By
evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs
suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results
indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving
only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically
for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the
highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%.
Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to
aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of
Philippine languages in LLM development.

Result: 实验表明，Marito显著提高了英语到Tshivenda机器翻译的准确性和领域一致性。

Conclusion: Marito为开发稳健且公平的NLP技术提供了可扩展的基础，确保南非丰富的语言多样性在数字时代得到体现。

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's
official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence
of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets
remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them
unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Marito} addresses
this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these
scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the
foundational \emph{Marito} dataset, released under the equitable,
Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we
integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific
consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language
models. \emph{Marito} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and
equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity
is represented in the digital age.

TL;DR: EmbedGrad提出了一种通过梯度优化文本提示嵌入的新框架，解决了现有离散优化和连续参数调整方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI部署中，如何有效适应预训练基础模型到多样任务仍是一个挑战，现有方法（如离散提示工程或连续参数调整）存在精度不足或复杂度高的问题。

Method: EmbedGrad通过梯度优化文本提示嵌入，分离训练和部署阶段，优化时用标记样本调整嵌入，推理时仅使用优化后的嵌入。

Result: 在数学推理、情感分析和因果判断任务中，EmbedGrad显著提升了性能，例如数学问题准确率从14.74%提升至58.96%。

Conclusion: EmbedGrad通过嵌入优化为任务适应提供了新范式，兼具提示工程和参数效率的优势。

Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks
remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow
two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,
or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit
limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based
techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these
constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt
embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples
training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise
embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only
optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained
calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning
capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive
evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal
judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning
prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on
mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model
scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for
smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt
engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work
establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task
adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型作为评估工具（LLM-as-a-judge）在复杂提示或微调下仍难以与人类偏好对齐，而中间层的表示可能更符合人类判断。

Method: LAGER通过聚合跨层的分数标记逻辑和基于softmax分布的期望分数，生成细粒度评分，同时保持模型主干冻结。

Result: 在标准对齐基准测试中，LAGER比最佳基线提升高达7.5%，且无需推理步骤即可匹配或超越基于推理的方法。

Conclusion: LAGER通过利用中间层信息，显著提升了LLM-as-a-judge的对齐性，并在下游应用中表现出有效性。

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of
automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as
"LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences
without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,
motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode
semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with
human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and
efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,
via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by
aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from
a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully
leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the
limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the
standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman
correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the
best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches
or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,
such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the
effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域转移中因灾难性遗忘导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出KILO框架，结合动态知识图谱和指令调优，利用领域知识指导训练。

Result: 在BioASQ等四个领域测试中，KILO在多项指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合结构化知识检索和指令提示能有效应对持续学习中的领域转移挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when
faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this
work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation),
a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs
with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as
guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and
retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on
WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target
domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that
KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual
fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward
transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and
instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning
scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their
development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks
often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with
incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect
real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal
evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each
component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880
pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4
document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data
contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence
pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.
Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4
MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text
and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building
stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the
over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to
provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source
Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced
document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new
benchmarks on an annual basis.

### [46] [Can Large Vision-Language Models Understand Multimodal Sarcasm?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03654)
*Xinyu Wang,Yue Zhang,Liqiang Jing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态讽刺分析（MSA）中的应用，提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过深度对象提取和外部概念知识提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺是一种复杂的语言现象，传统方法主要依赖文本，而多模态信息的使用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，结合深度对象提取和外部概念知识，以改进LVLMs在多模态讽刺检测和解释中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架在多个模型中有效提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决LVLMs在多模态讽刺分析中的局限性提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between
literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and
other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods
primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal
information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs)
in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we
evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm
Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual
understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we
propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction
and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret
and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on
multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is
available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CTR-Sink的新框架，通过引入行为级别的注意力汇聚点来解决用户行为序列与语言模型预训练之间的结构不匹配问题，从而提升点击率预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户行为序列由离散动作组成，与语言模型预训练的自然语言存在结构差异，导致语义碎片化，影响预测性能。

Method: 提出CTR-Sink框架，插入汇聚点标记并设计两阶段训练策略和注意力汇聚机制，以优化注意力分配。

Result: 在工业数据集和开源数据集（MovieLens、Kuairec）上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CTR-Sink通过行为级注意力汇聚点有效解决了语义碎片化问题，提升了点击率预测性能。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems,
estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user
behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has
gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual
modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior
sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty
separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM
pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention
scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior
boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.
To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing
behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired
by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically
regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we
insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating
recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable
attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy
that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink
mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral
correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source
datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the
method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Result: FairLangProc提供了一个集中且易用的平台，支持NLP中的公平性研究和应用。

Conclusion: FairLangProc有助于推动NLP公平性技术的普及和标准化。

Abstract: The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent
years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making
contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses
questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads
to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language
Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed
to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their
implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper
presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common
implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural
Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging
Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and
democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs在通用和专用代码生成基准上的表现差异，通过PartialOrderEval方法分析提示细节对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在专用基准（如ParEval）表现不佳的原因是缺乏领域知识还是提示细节不足。

Method: 引入PartialOrderEval，为代码生成基准提供从最小到最详细的提示序列，并测量pass@1随提示细节的变化。

Result: 实验显示不同任务对提示细节的敏感度不同，明确I/O规范、边缘案例处理和逐步分解是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: 提示细节的优化能显著提升LLMs在专用任务上的表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general
benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as
ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt
detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments
any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to
maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets
of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our
experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of
prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis
highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise
breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

TL;DR: CompassVerifier是一个轻量级验证模型，用于评估和奖励LLM输出，支持多领域任务，并引入VerifierBench基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏系统性基准和鲁棒性，无法处理复杂边缘案例和跨领域泛化。

Method: 开发CompassVerifier模型，结合VerifierBench基准，通过多领域数据和元错误模式增强验证能力。

Result: CompassVerifier在多领域任务中表现优异，能处理复杂答案类型并识别异常响应。

Conclusion: CompassVerifier和VerifierBench将推动答案验证、评估协议和强化学习研究。

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but
also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation
frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer
verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules
or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current
methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically
evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent
stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the
robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across
different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and
robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It
demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse
reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including
multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively
identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark
comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented
through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We
anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer
verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code

Motivation: 随着LLM驱动代理系统复杂度的增加，其成本问题威胁到可扩展性和可访问性，因此需要研究如何在保持性能的同时降低成本。

Method: 通过GAIA基准测试，评估了LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时扩展策略的影响，并使用成本-通过指标量化效率与性能的权衡。

Result: 提出的Efficient Agents框架在性能损失仅为3.3%的情况下，将运营成本从0.398美元降至0.228美元，提升了28.4%的成本效率。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效、高性能的代理系统提供了实用见解，推动了AI驱动解决方案的可访问性和可持续性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划假设对象集合固定，但实际应用中对象可能动态变化，因此需要新的规划方法。

Method: 基于一阶逻辑建模，限制初始理论为有限的流文字集合，并在规划时对动作序列进行接地搜索。

Result: 证明了方法的完备性和可靠性，适用于无DCA的有界规划问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态对象变化的规划问题提供了可行的解决方案，并通过概念验证实现展示了其潜力。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS数据稀疏性导致活动序列不完整，难以准确推断出行和活动，研究目标是利用高质量LBS数据恢复个体层面的不完整序列。

Method: 结合Insertion Transformer的灵活序列构建和Variable Selection Network的动态协变量处理能力，提出VSNIT方法。

Result: VSNIT能插入更多样化、真实的活动模式，更接近现实世界的变异性，且在恢复活动序列时表现显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出更高的准确性和多样性，为未来基于位置的研究和应用提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

Motivation: 现有AI框架在科学发现中缺乏透明性和可操控性，科学家需要更精准的推理控制工具。

Method: 引入CLIO方法，通过动态优化和开放设计，使大型语言模型能够自主调整推理过程并展示不确定性。

Result: CLIO使GPT-4.1在HLE测试中的准确率提升13.82%（相对提升161.64%），并揭示了不确定性振荡对结果的影响。

Conclusion: CLIO为科学决策提供了透明且可控的AI推理工具，其开放设计有助于深入理解推理机制。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

Motivation: 现有规划基准无法有效衡量基础模型和智能体的长期规划能力，存在任务定义模糊或依赖特定领域的问题。

Result: 理论分析证明了问题的计算复杂性，实验表明该基准对现有LLM方法极具挑战性。

Conclusion: Countdown游戏基准为规划能力评估提供了理想的标准，弥补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务分解和简单标准实现高效评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决渗透测试任务中难以程序化评估的问题，提供一种可扩展且高效的方法来验证AI安全代理的操作质量。

Method: 利用LLM作为裁判，结合工具调用历史和任务树结构，将复杂任务分解为简单子任务，并通过二元分类指标（如F1分数）与人类专家评分对比。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家表现。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在渗透测试任务中作为裁判的潜力，验证任务可能比生成任务更容易实现，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

Conclusion: 尽管仍需进一步校准和验证，但AQUAH展示了以LLM为核心的视觉代理在环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,

are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

TL;DR: Medblink是一个用于评估多模态语言模型（MLMs）在医学图像感知任务中表现的基准测试，结果显示当前模型在简单感知任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的采用非常谨慎，模型在简单感知任务（如图像方向判断）上的错误会阻碍其临床应用。

Method: 引入Medblink基准测试，涵盖8个临床相关任务，共1,429道多选题和1,605张图像，评估了19种先进MLMs。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为96.4%，而最佳模型仅达到65%，表明当前MLMs在视觉基础任务上表现不足。

Conclusion: 需加强MLMs的视觉基础能力以支持临床应用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

*Chia-Tung Ho,Jing Gong,Xufeng Yao,Yunsheng Bai,Abhishek B Akkur,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath是一种自优化代理，通过动态分层工作流解决现实动态问题，无需标记数据，性能提升8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标记数据的工作流生成方法在现实动态问题中效果有限，需要更灵活、自优化的解决方案。

Method: Polymath结合任务流图和代码表示工作流，采用多网格图优化和自反射进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，Polymath平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath为动态问题提供了一种无需标记数据的高效自优化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在AdvBench和Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024数据集上，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下实现近乎完美防御。

Conclusion: 自意识方法为LLM伦理提升提供了轻量级、经济高效的解决方案，适用于多平台GenAI应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Result: 实验显示代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍，兼容现有标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解和实际解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力和自主性的提升，其输出的评估成为关键瓶颈，尤其是开放性和复杂任务。AI代理作为评估者提供了一种可扩展且细致的替代方案。

Method: 定义了agent-as-a-judge概念，追溯了从单模型评估到动态多代理辩论框架的演变，并分析了其优缺点。

Result: 比较了不同方法在可靠性、成本和人类对齐方面的表现，并调查了在医疗、法律、金融和教育等领域的实际应用。

Conclusion: 代理评估可以补充（而非替代）人类监督，是迈向可信、可扩展评估的重要一步，但仍需解决偏见、鲁棒性和元评估等挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在交互环境中多轮代理规划的两大挑战：信用分配问题和计算开销问题。

Method: 提出BPO三阶段框架：引导（规划四元组与长短思维链融合）、外推（复杂度分层课程学习）、优化（奖励门控拒绝采样）。

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最优性能，显著提升令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新方法，解决了稀疏奖励和计算效率问题。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块策略，忽略了模块间的相互依赖，影响了求解速度和质量。

Method: 将MILP求解中的割平面选择和分支协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式（预训练和策略协调）稳定协作策略学习。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上显著提升求解性能，且策略表现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协作学习优化多模块策略，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了MILP求解效率和质量。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT-2能学习元ODE算法，性能优于欧拉方法，且随演示数量增加精度呈指数提升，还能泛化到分布外问题。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL机制提供了新见解，展示了其在解决非线性数值问题中的潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Result: 在真实医学数据上的实验表明，ToR框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架有效提升了大型语言模型在复杂医学场景中的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Result: 实验表明CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CDD框架有效解决了现有防御方法的局限性，为LLM的安全部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Result: 专有模型表现更优，开源模型在特定维度有竞争力；模型规模、推理模式、量化等影响性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLMs需针对性优化以适用于高法律风险场景，ContractEval为未来法律领域LLM开发提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Result: 在三个任务上的实验表明，EoH-S显著优于现有方法，性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S能够有效生成互补启发式集合，显著提升自动化启发式设计的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Conclusion: MissDDIM为表格数据插补提供了一种更高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成UEs的方法需要联合优化图像和文本噪声，计算成本高且依赖第三方服务，导致隐私泄露风险。

Result: 实验表明，T2UE保护的数据显著降低了下游任务性能，且保护效果泛化到多种架构和监督学习场景。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了“零接触数据保护”，仅需文本描述即可保护数据，无需直接暴露原始数据。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

TL;DR: 本文提出AgentSME框架，利用LLM为智能教育定制生成代理，通过三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo）验证其性能，发现Echo模式准确率最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能教育中生成代理模型的开发不足，且教育场景复杂，需个性化沟通。

Method: 提出AgentSME框架，采用三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo），以准确性和多样性为指标，测试六种LLM。

Result: Echo模式准确率最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代理学习能力和智能教育模型提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠LLM代理提供了可扩展、可验证且原则性的路径。

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Conclusion: AI模型可辅助环境教育，但需与人类专家结合以确保信息准确性。

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
models to bridge the knowledge gap in environmental education among university
students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

Conclusion: Geoint-R1为形式几何推理提供了有效解决方案，并通过Geoint基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全历史图模型和ETDNet网络，用于建模实体间随时间演化的交互关系，显著提升了驾驶意图预测和比特币欺诈检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多现实任务需要建模实体间随时间演化的交互关系，如交通中的车辆行为预测或金融欺诈检测。现有方法通常使用快照图，但无法明确区分关系和时间的演化。

Method: 提出全历史图模型，包含每个时间步的实体节点和两类边（时间步内边和时间步间边）。设计ETDNet网络，结合图注意力模块和时间注意力模块，分别处理两类边。

Result: 在Waymo驾驶意图预测和Elliptic++比特币欺诈检测任务中，ETDNet显著优于基线方法，分别将联合准确率提升至75.6%和F1分数提升至88.1%。

Conclusion: 通过在全历史图中明确区分结构和时间关系，ETDNet有效提升了建模动态交互的能力，验证了方法的优越性。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在工具增强的视觉问答（VQA）中表现良好，但在真实世界多模态环境中的工具使用能力仍有显著不足。

Method: 提出ToolVQA数据集和ToolEngine数据生成流水线，采用深度优先搜索（DFS）和动态上下文示例匹配机制模拟人类工具使用推理。

Result: 在ToolVQA上微调的7B LFMs在测试集和多个OOD数据集上表现优于GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine显著提升了模型在真实世界工具使用场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

TL;DR: Nemori是一种新型自组织记忆架构，解决了LLMs在长上下文中的记忆问题，通过两步对齐原则和预测校准原则实现自适应知识进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统依赖任意粒度的基本记忆单元和被动规则机制，限制了学习和进化能力，Nemori旨在解决这些限制。

Method: Nemori采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），实现语义连贯的记忆组织和主动学习。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长时动态工作流提供了可行路径，解决了记忆粒度和知识进化的关键问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。然而，将数据密集型、多模态边缘工作负载迁移到云端会引入显著延迟，而边缘部署又面临资源有限和异构的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，结合蚁群算法和基于LLM的优化，建模资源约束和延迟/成本，实现高效的代理放置和迁移决策。

Result: 在分布式系统中实现并验证，显著降低了部署延迟和迁移成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM-based AI代理的高效部署和管理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Motivation: LLMs使用CoT提示时生成冗余的思维过程，导致推理成本增加和效率降低，需要一种方法来压缩这些冗余。

Method: 引入步骤熵度量冗余，提出两阶段训练策略（SFT和GRPO强化学习），让LLM学会生成压缩的CoT。

Result: 实验证明低熵步骤高度冗余，剪枝80%后准确性几乎不受影响，而随机或高熵剪枝会严重损害性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升LLM推理效率并保持准确性，对实际部署和推理结构理解有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Result: 混合方法在通用逻辑推理上更具优势，因其推理链更可解释且保留了LLMs的能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于LLM-SS的通用框架，支持未来混合方法的研究。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Method: 1. 引入增强的UML序列图，整合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推理（DDI）任务，构建显式数据依赖图；3. 通过数学推理和静态解析优化推理过程。

Result: UML2Dep框架能够更准确地生成代码，减少模糊性，并提高复杂服务架构中的推理效率。

Conclusion: 通过形式化规范和逐步推理，UML2Dep显著提升了代码生成的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂错误的识别和诊断上表现不佳，主要因为训练目标偏向正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出HSG框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky生成隐蔽错误，Diagnosis检测错误，通过对抗协同进化提升能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，HSG显著提升错误诊断准确率，比基线高16.8%--31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG框架有效提升模型对复杂错误的诊断能力，并发布了具有挑战性的数据集供未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

*Kai Li,Ruihao Zheng,Xinye Hao,Zhenkun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOID结合LLM代理和多目标优化，为不可行路由问题提供多种诊断建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM方法无法处理多调整需求的不可行模型问题。

Method: 结合多目标优化和LLM代理，生成权衡解决方案并分析。

Result: 在50类问题中，MOID比现有方法提供更多实用建议。

Conclusion: MOID能有效诊断不可行模型并提供多样化建议。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开医学数据的快速增长导致临床医生和研究人员难以系统性地理解和应用最新知识，亟需自动化工具来提取和整合信息。

Method: 通过LLM代理管道分解PubMed摘要为语义命题句子，提取KG三元组，并结合开放领域和本体论方法增强三元组，引入上下文变量形成四元组。

Result: 提取的三元组生成的自然语言句子与原命题的平均余弦相似度为0.874，上下文变量显著提高了相似度。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学从业者提供了实时更新的集中知识源，并可能在其他领域实现类似效果。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信念系统表示方法（如概率分布或逻辑框架）忽略了内部结构，混淆了外部可信度和内部一致性，无法建模碎片化或矛盾的认知状态。

Method: 使用有向加权图表示信念系统，节点为个体信念，边表示认知关系（支持或矛盾），并通过两个函数分别量化可信度和置信度。

Result: 该模型不依赖先验一致性或信念更新，支持细粒度结构表示，避免了二元辩护状态或演绎闭包的限制。

Conclusion: 该形式主义为分析信念系统的内部组织提供了基础，包括一致性条件、认知紧张和表示限制，丰富了现有方法的分类能力。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen是一个基于LLM的框架，用于生成上下文感知的用户行为数据，以支持智能家居模型的持续适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化、生活方式改变等）。数据收集成本高且隐私敏感，因此需要一种高效的数据生成方法。

Method: SmartGen包含四个关键组件：时间与语义感知分割、语义感知序列压缩、图引导序列合成和两阶段异常过滤。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，SmartGen显著提升了模型在行为漂移下的性能，异常检测平均提高85.43%，行为预测平均提高70.51%。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过生成高质量的行为数据，有效解决了智能家居模型的行为漂移问题。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

real-life visual quizzes, and image-based questions that focus on improving
vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. The system integrates Vision-Language
Pretraining models to generate contextually relevant image description from
which Large Language Model generate assignments based on customized Arabic

  The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated through a manual annotated
benchmark consisting of 1266 real-life visual quizzes, with human participants
providing feedback. The results show a suitable accuracy rates, validating the
tool's potential to bridge the gap in Arabic language education and
highlighting the tool's promise as a reliable, AI-powered resource for Arabic
learners, offering personalized and interactive learning experiences.

TL;DR: EDCIM是一种用于检测和纠正大型语言模型在数学任务中生成错误的方法，通过结合轻量级和强大模型优化成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理中常产生错误，且难以遵守特定输出格式，导致最终预测不准确。

Method: EDCIM通过生成方程组并利用符号化错误检测框架识别错误，结合轻量级和强大模型优化效率。

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低计算和财务成本，同时保持或提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM通过平衡成本和准确性，有效解决了大型语言模型在数学任务中的错误问题。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大规模激活在训练过程中的涌现动态，以帮助模型设计者预测和控制其行为。

Method: 使用Pythia模型家族进行系统分析，通过指数调制的对数函数建模大规模激活的涌现，并开发机器学习框架预测关键参数。

Result: 发现大规模激活的涌现遵循可预测的数学模式，机器学习框架能高精度预测稳态行为，中等精度预测涌现时间和幅度。

Conclusion: 大规模激活的涌现受模型设计影响，可在训练前预测甚至控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期和优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

Motivation: 随着LLM代码生成能力的提升，其对输入前提的依赖增加，错误前提会导致代码生成幻觉，暴露模型自检能力的不足。

Method: 提出FPBench框架，系统构建三类错误前提，并整合多维评估指标，对15种LLM进行评估。

Result: 发现模型在错误前提下的推理能力和代码生成表现较差，资源投入存在边际递减效应，且三类错误前提分别激活不同的缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM在代码生成中主动验证前提的紧迫性，FPBench为开发可靠、以人为中心的代码生成模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Result: 在MLGWSC-1基准数据集上，性能提升20.2%，并发现新的算法组合。

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法论。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

Result: 在情感分析、新闻分类等任务中，BH-PEFT优于现有PEFT基线，支持不确定性量化和动态适应。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT为商业分析和数据科学提供了一种支持不确定性感知和自适应决策的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度学习模型在体育赛事预测中的应用，特别是针对NCAA篮球锦标赛。

Method: 利用历史比赛数据，结合GLM、Elo评分等特征，训练LSTM和Transformer模型，并使用BCE和Brier损失函数评估性能。

Result: Transformer模型在AUC上表现最佳（0.8473），而LSTM模型在Brier分数上最优（0.1589）。

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics
and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合密度网络（MDN）的概率建模框架，用于准确捕捉FeFET的随机性，解决了现有模型在稳定性和变异性捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFET的随机性（源于操作循环和制造变异性）对建模提出了挑战，现有确定性或机器学习模型无法全面捕捉变异性或缺乏数学平滑性。

Method: 采用MDN框架，结合C-infinity连续激活函数和设备特定嵌入层，生成合成设备实例进行变异性感知模拟。

Result: 模型在捕捉FeFET电流行为变异性上表现出高准确性（R2=0.92）。

Conclusion: 该框架为FeFET的随机行为建模提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，为未来紧凑模型开发和电路仿真集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich
structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering
spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance
of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large
pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken
from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas
Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that
pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly
sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural
network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms.
We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an
unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a
238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,
ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning

combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

TL;DR: SmallKV通过小模型辅助补偿机制解决KV缓存淘汰中的动态注意力模式和边际信息压缩问题，显著提升大模型性能和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法无法适应动态注意力模式且忽视边际信息的重要性。

Method: 设计基于不同规模LLM注意力矩阵相似性的补偿机制，提出SmallKV方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，吞吐量比基线方法高1.75-2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境下高效且性能优越。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出动态多尺度协调框架（DMSC），解决时间序列预测中的静态分解、依赖建模不完整和融合机制不灵活问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模复杂时间依赖时存在静态分解策略、依赖建模碎片化和融合机制不灵活的问题。

Method: DMSC包含多尺度块分解（EMPD）、三元交互块（TIB）和自适应尺度路由MoE块（ASR-MoE），动态分解序列并建模依赖关系。

Result: 在13个真实数据集上验证，DMSC表现最优且计算高效。

Conclusion: DMSC通过动态多尺度协调显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP模型依赖单一文本嵌入，无法充分捕捉多样语义。

Method: 引入多个结构化提示，每个提示包含自适应令牌，联合处理并组合成统一文本表示，结合多样性正则化和否定感知损失。

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索任务中表现优于基准。

Conclusion: 多提示嵌入方法显著提升了语义对齐和对比学习效果。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布鲁棒评估和学习方法过于保守，导致评估结果和策略不理想。

Method: 使用结构方程模型（SEM）构建不确定性集，并结合条件独立性检验检测变量偏移。

Result: SEM方法在评估准确性和策略方差降低方面优于传统方法，尤其在大偏移情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: SEM方法在模型充分指定的情况下能够学习到最优策略。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

TL;DR: GRPO是一种无评论家的强化学习算法，用于微调大语言模型，通过组归一化奖励替代PPO中的价值函数。研究发现其更新规则实际上是对旧策略的梯度估计，而非当前策略。基于此，提出了TIC GRPO，用轨迹级概率比替代令牌级重要性比率，提供无偏的当前策略梯度估计，并首次对GRPO类方法进行了理论收敛分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法的实际更新行为，发现其对旧策略的梯度估计存在偏差，但影响有限。基于此，提出改进算法TIC GRPO，以消除偏差并保持无评论家结构。

Method: GRPO通过组归一化奖励替代PPO中的价值函数，保留基于旧策略的令牌级重要性采样。TIC GRPO进一步用轨迹级概率比替代令牌级比率，提供无偏梯度估计。

Result: 实验表明，移除重要性采样后性能与标准GRPO相当。TIC GRPO在保持性能的同时提供了无偏梯度估计，并首次进行了理论收敛分析。

Conclusion: GRPO的偏差在实践中影响有限，而TIC GRPO进一步优化了梯度估计的无偏性，同时保持了算法的简洁性，为GRPO类方法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

Result: 提供了开源实现（grandjury PyPI包）和公开的LLM推理输出集合，展示了方法的必要性和有效性。

Conclusion: GrandJury为AI从业者提供了一种新的评估范式，适用于没有绝对真实值的机器学习输出评估。

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute
ground truth.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，防御方法效果显著，性能接近原始RAG系统。

Conclusion: FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG能有效防御PoisonedRAG攻击，保障RAG系统的安全性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Result: 在增强的MegaVul数据集上，模型大小减少99.4%，保持89.3%的准确率，训练时间减少72.1%。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

Motivation: 探索 KANs 在无监督故障检测中的应用潜力，尤其是在化学过程中，以验证其数据效率和性能。

Method: 比较四种 KAN-AE 变体（EfficientKAN, FastKAN, FourierKAN, WavKAN）与 Orthogonal Autoencoder (OAE) 在 Tennessee Eastman Process 上的表现，使用 Fault Detection Rate (FDR) 作为指标。

Result: WavKAN-AE 在 4,000 样本下达到最高 FDR（≥92%），EfficientKAN-AE 在低数据量（500 样本）下表现稳健（≥90%）。FastKAN-AE 在大规模数据下竞争，FourierKAN-AE 表现较差。OAE 需要更多数据才能匹配 KAN-AE。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs 结合了数据效率和强故障检测性能，其结构化基函数可能提升模型透明度，适合数据受限的工业场景。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

### [123] [Beyond Least Squares: Robust Regression Transformer (R2T)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02874)
*Roman Gutierrez,Tony Kai Tang,Isabel Gutierrez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合神经符号架构，通过Transformer编码器和压缩神经网络预测符号参数，结合固定符号方程重建序列，显著提升了在非对称结构化噪声下的回归性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最小二乘优化在高斯噪声下表现良好，但在非对称结构化噪声下效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合神经符号架构，包括Transformer编码器处理数值序列、压缩神经网络预测符号参数，以及固定符号方程重建序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，模型的中位回归MSE为6e-6至3.5e-5，比普通最小二乘和鲁棒回归技术（如Huber损失或SoftL1）提升了10-300倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习神经参数估计引导的符号拟合，显著提升了在非对称结构化噪声下的回归性能。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSFMs需要大量计算资源进行预训练，且依赖精心整理的真实数据。CauKer旨在通过合成数据解决这些问题。

Result: CauKer生成的数据集在数据集规模和模型容量上表现出清晰的缩放规律，优于真实数据集。

Conclusion: CauKer为TSFMs的高效预训练提供了可行方案，并展示了合成数据的潜力。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Result: 实验证明，初始正交雅可比矩阵能稳定训练，性能与残差网络相当，且无需传统跳跃连接。

Conclusion: 框架不仅涵盖标准架构，还扩展至部分等距网络，均保持良好训练特性。

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Conclusion: PENODE在保持物理可解释性的同时，支持高效的边缘部署和实时控制增强，为电力电子系统的监控和控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Conclusion: 论文总结了Clus-UCB的优势，并指出了当前工作的局限性及未来研究方向。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PLoRA显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能，适用于多种先进LLM。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: 理论分析显示RONAVI算法低遗憾，高效找到最优鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: 为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且鲁棒，适用于噪声感知的逆问题求解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable

Result: 在主流基准测试中，SMPQ表现优于基于梯度的方法。

Conclusion: SMPQ通过更准确的比特宽度贡献评估，实现了更优的性能。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially

TL;DR: VRPO框架通过强化价值模型和引入辅助损失与变分信息瓶颈，提升在噪声奖励监督下的PPO训练鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF中噪声奖励监督导致策略不稳定和泛化能力下降的问题，强调价值模型在噪声过滤中的关键作用。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，结合基于熵和困惑度的辅助损失与变分信息瓶颈，增强价值模型的噪声过滤能力。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和多轮对话任务中，VRPO优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 价值模型在RLHF中被低估，VRPO为噪声环境下的策略优化提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多类别决策问题需要有限适应性的算法，以减少策略更新的频率。

Method: 提出了B-MNL-CB（批处理）和RS-MNL（极少切换）两种算法，分别适用于随机和对抗性上下文生成场景。

Result: B-MNL-CB在随机上下文中实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，RS-MNL在对抗性上下文中同样实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，且实验表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 两种算法在有限适应性条件下表现优异，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

TL;DR: HiTeC提出了一种两阶段层次对比学习框架，用于文本属性超图的自监督学习，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在文本属性超图上存在三个主要问题：忽略文本与超图拓扑的关联、随机数据增强引入噪声、以及无法捕捉长距离依赖关系。

Method: HiTeC采用两阶段设计：第一阶段预训练文本编码器，第二阶段引入语义感知增强策略和多尺度对比损失。

Result: 实验证明HiTeC在文本属性超图上具有高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HiTeC通过语义感知增强和多尺度对比学习，显著提升了自监督学习的效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SGDM在动态学习率和批量大小调度下的收敛行为，为深度学习训练提供理论支持和实践指导。

Method: 提出一种结构更简单的Lyapunov函数，统一分析了三种动态调度策略的收敛性。

Result: 理论证明动态调度策略（ii）和（iii）能保证梯度范数收敛，且（iii）收敛速度更快；实验验证了动态调度的优越性。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习训练提供了统一的理论框架和实用建议，动态调度策略显著提升了收敛速度和稳定性。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法对特征空间的假设过于严格，限制了ID与OOD样本的可分离性。

Method: 采用伪标签诱导子空间表示，结合交叉熵分类损失和子空间距离正则化损失。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在更自然的假设下显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与现有最优方法相当，但显著提升了适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分子分析和结构模式发现等领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Motivation: RegMean独立合并线性层，忽略特征和信息的跨层传播，影响最终预测。

Method: RegMean++在RegMean目标中引入层内和跨层依赖关系。

Result: RegMean++在多种场景下优于RegMean，并达到先进水平。

Conclusion: RegMean++是一种简单有效的模型合并方法，性能优越。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced
model merging methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Frontier为大规模LLM推理的设计和优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for
MoE inference with expert parallelism (EP). It enables the simulation of
complex workflows like cross-cluster expert routing and advanced pipelining
strategies for latency hiding. To ensure fidelity and usability, Frontier
incorporates refined operator models for improved accuracy. Frontier empowers
the community to design and optimize the future of LLM inference at scale.

Result: MFT微调的GPT-OSS在生物和网络安全领域表现低于前沿闭源模型（如OpenAI o3），对开源模型的危害提升有限。

Conclusion: 研究支持GPT-OSS的发布，MFT方法可作为未来开源模型风险评估的参考。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Conclusion: 该方法通过集群特定分析提升了可解释性和实用性，为房产市场参与者提供了更可靠的估值工具。

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable

Motivation: 现有选择性状态空间模型（如Mamba）依赖启发式设计，缺乏理论依据，可能影响其最优性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出预测充分性原则，并基于此设计MPS-SSM模型，通过优化目标函数实现选择性机制。

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在长期预测和噪声场景中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优越，其原则还可推广为通用正则化框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Conclusion: CoTox展示了LLM框架在提高可解释性和支持早期药物安全性评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

Motivation: 探讨透明性和可调整性在减少算法厌恶中的交互作用。

Method: 通过预注册用户研究（280名参与者），比较可调整预测和透明模型的效果。

Result: 可调整性显著减少算法厌恶，透明性影响较小且不显著。

Conclusion: 透明性和可调整性对减少算法厌恶的作用独立，透明性效果不如预期。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax在训练中目标类别的分数无法达到1，导致训练持续且易过拟合，同时浪费资源处理已正确分类的样本。

Method: 提出AS-Softmax，通过稀疏化忽略低分类别，专注于区分目标类与其强对手，并采用自适应梯度累积加速训练。

Result: AS-Softmax在多种任务中表现优于标准softmax，且训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax有效解决了softmax的缺陷，提升了训练效率和分类性能。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Result: 首次为Heun采样器提供Wasserstein收敛界，并改进Euler采样器的现有结果。

Conclusion: 空间规律性和分数误差控制对扩散生成模型的收敛性至关重要。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Conformal Prediction的Machine Unlearning方法，提供统计保证，无需重新训练，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私需求增加（如GDPR和CCPA），现有MU方法缺乏统计保证且计算成本高。

Method: 基于Conformal Prediction定义MU，提出ECF和EuCF指标，设计优化这些指标的实用方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效移除目标数据。

Conclusion: 新方法为MU提供了统计保证和高效实现。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字广告平台中的实时竞价系统因广告主异质性（预算和ROI目标差异大）导致传统自动竞价方法效率低下且泛化能力不足。

Method: HALO引入后见机制，将探索数据重新用于任意约束配置的训练，并采用B样条函数表示实现跨约束空间的连续、导数感知的竞价映射。

Result: 在工业数据集上的评估表明，HALO能有效处理多尺度约束，减少约束违规并提升GMV。

Conclusion: HALO通过理论支持的后见机制和函数表示，显著提升了自动竞价在复杂约束环境中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Conclusion: 该方法通过人类可理解的时间模式进行分类，并生成局部和全局的符号解释，提升了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Motivation: 为了处理复数数据，扩展alpha-beta散度的定义，填补现有文献中的空白。

Method: 通过调整散度的超参数，将alpha-beta散度推广到复数向量，并优化均值失真以获得闭式解。

Result: 新定义的散度在超参数为1时退化为欧几里得和马氏距离，其他选择则扩展了经典散度。

Conclusion: 该扩展为复数数据的信号处理提供了灵活的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

Motivation: 研究超关系知识图嵌入（HKGE）模型的优越性能是否源于其基础KGE模型或专门设计的扩展模块，以及分解方法对HKG信息保留的影响。

Method: 将HKG数据转换为KG格式，评估经典KGE模型性能；提出FormerGNN框架，结合GNN编码器和改进的信息整合方法。

Result: 部分KGE模型性能接近HKGE模型；分解方法改变HKG拓扑且信息保留不全；FormerGNN性能优于现有HKGE模型。

Conclusion: 分解方法影响HKG信息保留；FormerGNN通过保留原始拓扑和整合信息，为HKGE研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Result: 论文提供了明确的在线持续学习在图上的定义，并通过基准测试展示了不同方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了在线持续学习在图上的空白，为未来的研究提供了基础和方向。

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中，成功率从20%提升至39%，并在SWE-rebench中表现优于其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开源模型构建更强大的自主智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

Result: 研究发现委托人的错误行为在可计算的关键p值阈值下表现出单调性，从而为最优p值阈值提供了可解释性特征。

Conclusion: 研究为假设检验框架下的策略性互动提供了全面视角，兼具技术和监管意义。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

Motivation: 解决低秩适配器因秩限制导致表达能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出MoKA，利用门控机制衡量Kronecker因子的重要性，并优化计算以实现硬件效率。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B和LLaMA3-8B上实验，MoKA性能优于基线，参数减少27倍。

Conclusion: MoKA在性能和参数效率间实现了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Conclusion: 研究为机器学习实践者提供了优化测试数据收集的方法，以在预算内最大化评估可靠性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ是一种基于指标的量化框架，通过层间诊断实现低比特压缩，显著提升小语言模型在资源受限设备上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低比特压缩下精度损失严重的问题，优化内存和能源消耗。

Method: 引入三种层间诊断指标（困惑度下降、表示紧凑性和Top-k能量增益），自动分配比特宽度，无需梯度更新。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和LLaMA3.2-3B上，LieQ在2比特量化下分别恢复95.9%和98.2%的基线性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限设备上的小语言模型部署提供了新的高效量化范式。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的方案，用于从热脱附光谱（TDS）中提取氢陷阱参数，解决了传统间接方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDS方法提取氢陷阱参数（如结合能和密度）存在挑战，因此需要一种更直接且高效的方法。

Method: 开发了一个多神经网络模型，包括分类网络（预测陷阱类型数量）和回归网络（预测陷阱密度和结合能），并优化了网络结构和数据预处理。

Result: 模型在三种不同成分的回火马氏体钢上表现出强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为氢陷阱参数的直接提取提供了高效解决方案，并开源了相关代码。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分类方法在现实场景中需要持续标注的不切实际问题，实现实时、个性化的健康监测。

Method: 采用UniTS（先进的通用时间序列模型）进行异常检测，结合可穿戴设备和环境智能，无需持续标注。

Result: 在12种先进异常检测方法中表现最优，F1分数提升约22%，适用于医疗设备和消费级可穿戴设备。

Conclusion: 系统成功部署于家庭环境，证明非侵入式设备可实现高质量健康监测，并通过LLM增强结果的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

Motivation: 药物发现过程中数据、专业知识和工具的分散导致设计周期变慢，亟需一种自动化框架来加速分子优化。

Method: 采用分层智能体框架，包括数据库代理、AI专家、药物化学家、排名代理和科学评论家，通过工具调用和简洁的溯源记录实现协作。

Result: 多智能体设置显著提高了预测结合亲和力（31%），而单智能体生成的分子具有更好的药物特性。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架将通用LLM转化为可审计的分子设计系统，未来可扩展工具集以进一步优化药物发现流程。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

TL;DR: SLA-MORL是一个多目标强化学习框架，用于动态分配云环境中的GPU和CPU资源，平衡训练时间、成本和SLA合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态资源分配或单目标优化方法导致的SLA违规或资源浪费问题。

Method: 采用多目标强化学习框架，结合智能初始化和动态权重适应技术，构建21维状态表示和9种动作空间。

Result: 在13种ML工作负载上，SLA-MORL显著减少了训练时间（67.2%）、成本（68.8%）并提高了SLA合规性（73.4%）。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL为云资源管理提供了高效、自适应的解决方案，平衡了性能、成本和可靠性。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

TL;DR: VRPRM通过视觉推理和两阶段训练策略，以更低的数据标注成本提升过程奖励模型（PRM）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，而引入Chain-of-Thought（CoT）的PRM数据标注成本过高。

Method: 提出VRPRM模型，结合视觉推理，设计两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅用3.6K CoT-PRM数据和50K非CoT数据，性能超越400K数据的非思考PRM，BoN实验中相对基准模型提升118%。

Conclusion: VRPRM为PRM训练提供了高效数据利用的新范式，能以低成本实现高质量推理。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: Horus是一个针对联邦学习中异构性和投毒攻击的鲁棒框架，通过低秩适应（LoRA）减少攻击面并提高检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在超异构环境下易受投毒攻击，且高维模型增加了攻击面，需要一种鲁棒框架来解决这些问题。

Method: Horus在稳定层中插入LoRA模块，仅聚合LoRA以减少攻击面，并利用LoRA-A的稳定性设计投毒分数和投影感知聚合机制。

Result: 实验表明，Horus在多样数据集、模型架构和攻击下，鲁棒性和准确性均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Horus通过LoRA和异构性无关的投毒检测机制，有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有XAI方法缺乏统一的评估标准，难以客观优化。

Method: 提出DeepFaith框架，整合多指标优化，设计学习框架训练解释器。

Result: 在12个任务中，DeepFaith在10个指标上表现最优。

Conclusion: DeepFaith提供理论上的最优解释，具有跨领域通用性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

Motivation: 传统VAE训练中，随机采样潜在变量引入的梯度估计方差会减缓收敛并降低性能。

Method: 利用特定解码器架构解析计算ELBO期望，提出零方差梯度方法，并通过训练动态将其与随机估计器结合。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了该方法优于现有估计器（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax和REINFORCE）。

Conclusion: Silent Gradients为生成模型训练提供了新方向，结合了解析计算的稳定性和深度非线性架构的表达能力。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI模型在产量偏离历史趋势时表现不佳的问题，特别是数据不对称的挑战。

Method: 提出VITA框架，利用天气变量作为代理目标进行预训练，通过自监督特征掩码学习预测大气状态。

Result: 在美国玉米带的763个县中，VITA在预测玉米和大豆产量方面表现最佳，尤其在极端天气年份显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: VITA展示了领域感知的AI设计如何克服数据限制，支持气候变化下的农业预测。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Method: SolarSeer利用历史卫星观测数据，直接生成未来24小时的云覆盖和太阳辐照度预测，无需数据同化和求解偏微分方程。

Result: SolarSeer在CONUS地区的预测中，均方根误差比HRRR模型降低了27.28%（再分析数据）和15.35%（1800个站点），且能有效捕捉辐照度波动。

Conclusion: SolarSeer为可持续能源系统的转型提供了快速、准确的太阳辐照度预测支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

Result: 随机选择的小特征子集（0.02%-1%）性能与全特征集相当，甚至优于某些研究中选出的特征。

Conclusion: 特征选择在高维数据分类任务中效果有限，对基于计算选择基因的研究提出质疑。

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in

Conclusion: 最小化循环结构与卷积输入结合，为时空序列建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了高斯混合模型（GMMs）的学习问题，提出了一种新的几何量PCF，取代传统的最小间隔来衡量样本复杂度，并在均匀球形情况下给出了改进的样本复杂度算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将样本复杂度与组件间的最小间隔挂钩，但作者认为这种观点不完整，希望通过引入PCF更准确地描述参数恢复的难度。

Method: 引入Pair Correlation Factor (PCF)作为新的几何量，并在均匀球形情况下提出改进的样本复杂度算法。

Result: PCF比最小间隔更能准确反映样本复杂度，且在均匀球形情况下，算法展示了在某些情况下需要超过常规样本量的必要性。

Conclusion: PCF是一个更有效的衡量标准，为高斯混合模型的学习提供了新的视角和改进的算法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于患者特定权重的预训练模型微调方法，以解决癫痫患者数据分布差异导致的跨患者问题，显著提升分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫发作起始区（SOZ）的识别对手术治疗至关重要，但依赖专家视觉判断且患者数据分布差异大，导致机器学习模型在新患者数据上性能不稳定。

Method: 先通过监督学习训练模型，再基于测试患者数据定义训练患者数据的权重，最后用这些权重微调预训练模型。

Result: 实验采用留一患者法，结果显示每位测试患者的分类准确性平均提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨患者问题，显著提升了模型在新患者数据上的诊断性能。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Result: 结构规律性能够产生更稳定的表示几何，提高跨模型特征的互操作性。

Conclusion: 结构约束不仅支持模型内的泛化，还提升了跨模型特征的可迁移性，对模型蒸馏和模块化学习有重要意义。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Method: 比较直接调整模型权重、输入可学习适配器和前缀调优技术，用于在线微调。

Result: PEFT技术结合预训练显著减少样本需求，仅调整不到1%的参数即可提升策略性能。

Conclusion: PEFT与形态感知预训练结合是一种高效的方法，适用于机器人等实际应用。

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Motivation: 由于LLMs生成的输出缺乏可验证的保证，作者希望通过合同层提供语义和类型约束，以提升生成内容的可靠性和可控性。

Method: 通过引入合同层，规定输入输出的语义和类型要求，并结合概率性修正机制，引导LLMs生成符合契约的内容。

Result: 合同层实现了对LLMs生成内容的语义和类型验证，并通过概率性修正提高了合规性。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一种验证LLMs功能等效性的方法，认为满足相同契约的代理在功能上是等效的。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

Result: 实验验证了SkyGP在性能和效率上的优越性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SkyGP成功解决了高斯过程在流式数据中的计算和内存问题，同时保持了学习性能。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型是否能够仅通过自我生成问题和答案来提升推理能力，而无需依赖外部数据。

Method: 采用非对称自博弈框架，包括一个生成问题的提议者和一个解答问题的求解器，两者通过强化学习训练。提议者根据问题难度获得奖励，求解器通过多数投票机制获得奖励。

Result: 在三位数乘法、OMEGA代数问题和Codeforces编程问题三个基准测试中，模型通过自我生成问题和解答提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语言模型可以通过自我生成问题和解答持续提升性能，无需依赖外部训练数据。

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶或机器人等领域，错误可能带来严重后果，因此需要可靠策略而非仅平均性能。传统IRL需要大量人类演示，成本高。

Method: 引入PAC-EIG，最大化关于学徒策略遗憾的信息增益，高效识别需要进一步演示的状态。还提出Reward-EIG作为替代方法。

Result: 证明了收敛界限，展示了先前启发式方法的失败模式，并通过实验验证了方法的优势。

Conclusion: PAC-EIG为主动IRL提供了首个理论保证，显著提升了策略的可靠性。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Abstract: Students' mental well-being is vital for academic success, with activities
such as studying, socializing, and sleeping playing a role. Current mobile
sensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine
learning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to
model student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each
LLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by
smartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict
individual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological
momentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality
questionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting
techniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management
strategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily
activities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This
allows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original
dataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the
impact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by
manipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using
questionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral
changes that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates
hypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their
mental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling
with sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student
mental health.

Abstract: Emotional and mental well-being are vital components of quality of life, and
with the rise of smart devices like smartphones, wearables, and artificial
intelligence (AI), new opportunities for monitoring emotions in everyday
settings have emerged. However, for AI algorithms to be effective, they require
high-quality data and accurate annotations. As the focus shifts towards
collecting emotion data in real-world environments to capture more authentic
emotional experiences, the process of gathering emotion annotations has become
increasingly complex. This work explores the challenges of everyday emotion
data collection from the perspectives of key stakeholders. We collected 75
survey responses, performed 32 interviews with the public, and 3 focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 12 mental health professionals. The insights gained
from a total of 119 stakeholders informed the development of our framework,
AnnoSense, designed to support everyday emotion data collection for AI. This
framework was then evaluated by 25 emotion AI experts for its clarity,
usefulness, and adaptability. Lastly, we discuss the potential next steps and
implications of AnnoSense for future research in emotion AI, highlighting its
potential to enhance the collection and analysis of emotion data in real-world
contexts.

Conclusion: 研究为设计情境感知、适应性干预提供了实用见解，确保干预不仅及时且可行。

Abstract: The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has enabled real-time
monitoring and intervention for mental health conditions using passively sensed
smartphone data. Building on these capabilities, Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs) seek to deliver personalized support at opportune
moments, adapting to users' evolving contexts and needs. Although prior
research has examined how context affects user responses to generic
notifications and general mHealth messages, relatively little work has explored
its influence on engagement with actual mental health interventions.
Furthermore, while much of the existing research has focused on detecting when
users might benefit from an intervention, less attention has been paid to
understanding receptivity, i.e., users' willingness and ability to engage with
and act upon the intervention.
  In this study, we investigate user receptivity through two components:
acceptance(acknowledging or engaging with a prompt) and feasibility (ability to
act given situational constraints). We conducted a two-week in-the-wild study
with 70 students using a custom Android app, LogMe, which collected passive
sensor data and active context reports to prompt mental health interventions.
The adaptive intervention module was built using Thompson Sampling, a
reinforcement learning algorithm. We address four research questions relating
smartphone features and self-reported contexts to acceptance and feasibility,
and examine whether an adaptive reinforcement learning approach can optimize
intervention delivery by maximizing a combined receptivity reward. Our results
show that several types of passively sensed data significantly influenced user
receptivity to interventions. Our findings contribute insights into the design
of context-aware, adaptive interventions that are not only timely but also
actionable in real-world settings.

Result: NeuroSync通过技术实验和用户研究（N=12）验证，结果显示其提高了意图-任务对齐性，降低了认知负担，提升了编码效率。

Conclusion: 直接意图-任务匹配范式及NeuroSync工具能有效解决意图与代码不对齐问题，提升用户体验和编码效率。

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited
programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often
face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in
frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause
of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents
and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and
interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we
propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that
externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,
the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code
generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in
NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM
understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by
allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We
evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and
assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The
results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort,
and improves coding efficiency.

Conclusion: 建议改进技术设计，支持版主工作，并强调其对减少药物使用危害的重要性。

Abstract: Online communities serve as essential support channels for People Who Use
Drugs (PWUD), providing access to peer support and harm reduction information.
The moderation of these communities involves consequential decisions affecting
member safety, yet existing sociotechnical systems provide insufficient support
for moderators. Through interviews with experienced moderators from PWUD forums
on Reddit, we analyse the unique nature of this work. We argue that this work
constitutes a distinct form of public health intervention characterised by
three moderation challenges: the need for specialised, expert risk assessment;
time-critical crisis response; and the navigation of a structural conflict
between platform policies and community safety goals. We demonstrate how
current moderation systems are insufficient in supporting PWUD communities. For
example, policies minimising platforms' legal exposure to illicit activities
can inadvertently push moderators to implement restrictive rules to protect
community's existence, which can limit such a vulnerable group's ability to
share potentially life-saving resources online. We conclude by identifying two
necessary shifts in sociotechnical design to support moderators' work: first,
moving to automated tools that support human sensemaking in contexts with
competing interests; and second, shifting from systems that require moderators
to perform low-level rule programming to those that enable high-level,
example-based instruction. Further, we highlight how the design of
sociotechnical systems in online spaces could impact harm reduction efforts
aimed at improving health outcomes for PWUD communities.

VRSight, an end-to-end system that recognizes VR scenes post hoc through a set
of AI models (e.g., object detection, depth estimation, LLM-based atmosphere
interpretation) and generates tone-based, spatial audio feedback, empowering
blind users to interact in VR without developer intervention. To enable virtual
element detection, we further contribute DISCOVR, a VR dataset consisting of 30
virtual object classes from 17 social VR apps, substituting real-world datasets
that remain not applicable to VR contexts. Nine participants used VRSight to
explore an off-the-shelf VR app (Rec Room), demonstrating its effectiveness in
facilitating social tasks like avatar awareness and available seat

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, and their integration with
Extended Reality (XR) is poised to transform how users interact with immersive
environments. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent
developments at the intersection of LLMs and XR, offering a structured
organization of research along both technical and application dimensions. We
propose a taxonomy of LLM-enhanced XR systems centered on key technical
paradigms -- such as interactive agent control, XR development toolkits, and
generative scene synthesis -- and discuss how these paradigms enable novel
capabilities in XR. In parallel, we examine how LLM-driven techniques support
practical XR applications across diverse domains, including immersive
education, clinical healthcare, and industrial manufacturing. By connecting
these technical paradigms with application frontiers, our survey highlights
current trends, delineates design considerations, and identifies open
challenges in building LLM-augmented XR systems. This work provides insights
that can guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of the art
in intelligent XR experiences.

### [198] [Facilitating Visual Media Exploration for Blind and Low Vision Users through AI-Powered Interactive Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03061)
*Shuchang Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种AI驱动的交互式叙事范式，帮助盲人和低视力用户在连贯的故事体验中探索视觉媒体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具将视觉媒体探索与主叙事分离，破坏了叙事连贯性，增加了认知负担。

Method: 采用三种技术实现交互式叙事：分层叙事、平行叙事和分支叙事。

Result: 这些技术在不同媒体格式中平衡了用户自主性与叙事连贯性。

Conclusion: 未来工作将进一步提升个性化和表达性叙事体验。

Abstract: Empowering blind and low vision (BLV) users to explore visual media improves
content comprehension, strengthens user agency, and fulfills diverse
information needs. However, most existing tools separate exploration from the
main narration, which disrupts the narrative flow, increases cognitive load,
and limits deep engagement with visual media. To address these challenges, my
PhD research introduces the paradigm of AI-powered interactive storytelling,
which leverages AI to generate interactive narratives, enabling BLV users to
explore visual media within a coherent storytelling experience. I have
operationalized this paradigm through three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Narrative, which supports photo-collection exploration at different levels of
detail; (2) Parallel Narrative, which provides seamless access to time-synced
video comments; and (3) Branching Narrative, which enables immersive navigation
of 360{\deg} videos. Together, these techniques demonstrate that AI-powered
interactive storytelling can effectively balance user agency with narrative
coherence across diverse media formats. My future work will advance this
paradigm by enabling more personalized and expressive storytelling experiences
for BLV audiences.

### [199] [StoryEnsemble: Enabling Dynamic Exploration & Iteration in the Design Process with AI and Forward-Backward Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03182)
*Sangho Suh,Michael Lai,Kevin Pu,Steven P. Dow,Tovi Grossman*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出StoryEnsemble工具，通过AI支持设计过程中的动态探索与迭代，解决了时间和资源限制对设计实践的阻碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计过程中时间和资源限制常阻碍设计师广泛探索和迭代，难以坚持核心设计原则。

Method: 通过15人形成性研究开发StoryEnsemble工具，结合AI和节点链接界面，支持多向迭代。

Result: 10人用户研究表明，StoryEnsemble能实现快速、多向迭代和灵活导航。

Conclusion: StoryEnsemble通过AI引入新颖交互，使设计探索和迭代更流畅、易用和吸引人。

Abstract: Design processes involve exploration, iteration, and movement across
interconnected stages such as persona creation, problem framing, solution
ideation, and prototyping. However, time and resource constraints often hinder
designers from exploring broadly, collecting feedback, and revisiting earlier
assumptions-making it difficult to uphold core design principles in practice.
To better understand these challenges, we conducted a formative study with 15
participants-comprised of UX practitioners, students, and instructors. Based on
the findings, we developed StoryEnsemble, a tool that integrates AI into a
node-link interface and leverages forward and backward propagation to support
dynamic exploration and iteration across the design process. A user study with
10 participants showed that StoryEnsemble enables rapid, multi-directional
iteration and flexible navigation across design stages. This work advances our
understanding of how AI can foster more iterative design practices by
introducing novel interactions that make exploration and iteration more fluid,
accessible, and engaging.

### [200] [Navigation Pixie: Implementation and Empirical Study Toward On-demand Navigation Agents in Commercial Metaverse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03216)
*Hikari Yanagawa,Yuichi Hiroi,Satomi Tokida,Yuji Hatada,Takefumi Hiraki*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Navigation Pixie的动态导航代理，通过结合空间元数据和LLM自然语言处理，显著提升了用户在商业元宇宙平台中的探索体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业元宇宙平台缺乏动态适应用户兴趣和意图的导航辅助工具，现有研究在商业环境中的实现存在挑战。

Method: 采用松散耦合架构，整合结构化空间元数据和LLM自然语言处理，减少平台依赖性，并在Cluster平台上进行跨平台实验。

Result: 实验显示Navigation Pixie显著增加了用户在PC和VR-HMD平台上的停留时间和自由探索，且主观评价表明PC环境和VR-HMD环境有不同的优势。

Conclusion: 该研究通过对话式空间导航代理推动了VR交互设计，建立了跨平台评估方法，并展示了商业元宇宙平台的实证实验框架。

Abstract: While commercial metaverse platforms offer diverse user-generated content,
they lack effective navigation assistance that can dynamically adapt to users'
interests and intentions. Although previous research has investigated on-demand
agents in controlled environments, implementation in commercial settings with
diverse world configurations and platform constraints remains challenging.
  We present Navigation Pixie, an on-demand navigation agent employing a
loosely coupled architecture that integrates structured spatial metadata with
LLM-based natural language processing while minimizing platform dependencies,
which enables experiments on the extensive user base of commercial metaverse
platforms. Our cross-platform experiments on commercial metaverse platform
Cluster with 99 PC client and 94 VR-HMD participants demonstrated that
Navigation Pixie significantly increased dwell time and free exploration
compared to fixed-route and no-agent conditions across both platforms.
Subjective evaluations revealed consistent on-demand preferences in PC
environments versus context-dependent social perception advantages in VR-HMD.
This research contributes to advancing VR interaction design through
conversational spatial navigation agents, establishes cross-platform evaluation
methodologies revealing environment-dependent effectiveness, and demonstrates
empirical experimentation frameworks for commercial metaverse platforms.

Motivation: 研究混合交通环境中自动化车辆、手动操作车辆和弱势道路用户的交互挑战，填补单智能体研究的不足。

Method: 采用参与式研讨会（N=15）和问卷调查（N=19）的方法，探讨多智能体研究的方法论挑战与机遇。

Result: 研究发现多智能体方法的价值被广泛认可，但实际和技术障碍阻碍了其应用。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要跨学科方法、更好的工具和仿真环境，以支持可扩展且符合伦理的多智能体研究。

Abstract: The transition to mixed-traffic environments that involve automated vehicles,
manually operated vehicles, and vulnerable road users presents new challenges
for human-centered automotive research. Despite this, most studies in the
domain focus on single-agent interactions. This paper reports on a
participatory workshop (N = 15) and a questionnaire (N = 19) conducted during
the AutomotiveUI '24 conference to explore the state of multi-agent automotive
research. The participants discussed methodological challenges and
opportunities in real-world settings, simulations, and computational modeling.
Key findings reveal that while the value of multi-agent approaches is widely
recognized, practical and technical barriers hinder their implementation. The
study highlights the need for interdisciplinary methods, better tools, and
simulation environments that support scalable, realistic, and ethically
informed multi-agent research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了联合人类-AI推理在机器人任务中的潜力，发现基于置信度的选择能提高准确性，但AI校准不良会损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助任务中，人类与AI的互补性因判断失误难以实现，研究旨在探索联合推理的优化方法。

Method: 通过100名参与者的模拟机器人远程操作实验，研究基于置信度的联合推理及其受AI校准的影响。

Result: 联合推理准确性更高，但AI校准不良会降低性能；人类会根据AI建议调整判断。

Conclusion: 良好的AI校准对联合推理至关重要，研究首次在模拟任务中应用了最大置信度启发式方法。

Abstract: Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in
human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the
AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based
on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when
to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved.
We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher
confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a
representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the
inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy
is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI
agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and
the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence
calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing
poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the
team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good
metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the
first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI
inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.

### [203] [Remini: Leveraging Chatbot-Mediated Mutual Reminiscence for Promoting Positive Affect and Feeling of Connectedness among Loved Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03355)
*Zhuoqun Jiang,ShunYi Yeo,Wei Xuan Donovan Seow,Simon Perrault*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Remini是一个聊天机器人，旨在通过结构化对话支持伴侣、朋友或家人之间的共同回忆，提升情感联系和幸福感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术工具多关注个体回忆或单向叙事，忽视了互动对话对共同回忆的重要性。

Method: 基于SFAM框架，Remini通过五个叙事阶段（建立关系、记忆叙述、详细描述、反思和总结）引导情感丰富的对话。研究采用混合方法，比较Remini与基线聊天机器人的效果。

Result: Remini显著提升了积极情绪、连接感和参与度，促进了更详细的叙事共建和更多自我披露。

Conclusion: 研究为通过聊天机器人增强人际联系的对话设计提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Mutual reminiscence, defined as revisiting shared positive memories through
reciprocal self-disclosure, strengthens emotional bonds, enhances well-being,
and deepens intimacy. However, most technology-mediated reminiscence tools
emphasize individual reflection or one-way storytelling, which overlooks the
dynamic, interactive dialogue essential for meaningful mutual reminiscence. To
address this limitation, we introduce Remini, a chatbot designed to support
reciprocal self-disclosure between close partners such as couples, friends, or
family members. Grounded in the Social Functions of Autobiographical Memory
(SFAM) framework, Remini uses conversational AI to guide emotionally rich
exchanges through five narrative phases: rapport building, memory narration,
elaboration, reflection, and summary. In a mixed-method, both between- and
within- subjects study (N = 48, 24 dyads), we compare Remini to a baseline
chatbot that offers minimal memory-trigger prompts. Our findings show that
structured guidance from Remini significantly improves positive affect, feeling
of connection, and engagement. It also fosters more detailed narrative
co-construction and greater reciprocal self-disclosure. Participant feedback
highlights the practical value, perceived benefits, and design considerations
of chatbot-mediated reminiscence. We contribute empirically grounded design
implications for conversational agents that strengthen human connection through
mutual reminiscence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为‘科幻科学’的实验方法，通过模拟未来技术来量化预测其社会和行为影响，并探讨了该方法未被广泛接受的原因及改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来技术的社会和行为影响，以指导其开发和监管，避免负面影响固化。传统方法依赖定性分析，缺乏量化手段。

Method: 采用实验方法模拟未来技术，通过控制变量收集参与者的态度和行为数据，称为‘科幻科学’。

Result: 尽管‘科幻科学’方法潜力巨大，但因实验科学家对其有效性的担忧而未被广泛接受。

Conclusion: 需通过约束研究范围和采用沉浸式方法提升‘科幻科学’的有效性，推动其成为主流研究工具。

Abstract: Predicting the social and behavioral impact of future technologies, before
they are achieved, would allow us to guide their development and regulation
before these impacts get entrenched. Traditionally, this prediction has relied
on qualitative, narrative methods. Here we describe a method which uses
experimental methods to simulate future technologies, and collect quantitative
measures of the attitudes and behaviors of participants assigned to controlled
variations of the future. We call this method 'science fiction science'. We
suggest that the reason why this method has not been fully embraced yet,
despite its potential benefits, is that experimental scientists may be
reluctant to engage in work facing such serious validity threats as science
fiction science. To address these threats, we consider possible constraints on
the kind of technology that science fiction science may study, as well as the
unconventional, immersive methods that science fiction science may require. We
seek to provide perspective on the reasons why this method has been
marginalized for so long, what benefits it would bring if it could be built on
strong yet unusual methods, and how we can normalize these methods to help the
diverse community of science fiction scientists to engage in a virtuous cycle
of validity improvement.

*Ada Yi Zhao,Aditya Gunturu,Ellen Yi-Luen Do,Ryo Suzuki*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Guided Reality的自动化AR系统，结合LLM和视觉模型，生成动态视觉指导以增强用户对物理任务的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的AR指导缺乏丰富的视觉增强，难以将指令有效嵌入空间环境。

Method: 系统整合LLM和视觉模型，生成多步骤指令、识别视觉指导类型、提取空间信息并嵌入物理空间。

Result: 通过用户研究（N=16）验证系统有效性，并收集了四位教师的反馈。

Conclusion: Guided Reality展示了自动化生成动态视觉指导的潜力，可提升AR指导的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of
step-by-step augmented reality (AR) instructions for a wide range of physical
tasks. However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual
augmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a
better user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR
system that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on
step-by-step instructions. Our system integrates LLMs and vision models to: 1)
generate multi-step instructions from user queries, 2) identify appropriate
types of visual guidance, 3) extract spatial information about key interaction
points in the real world, and 4) embed visual guidance in physical space to
support task execution. Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five
categories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on
the current step. We evaluate the system through a user study (N=16),
completing real-world tasks and exploring the system in the wild. Additionally,
four instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into
their training workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估特定图形设计（如幻灯片）是一个未解决的问题，SlideAudit旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 与设计专家合作开发了幻灯片设计缺陷的分类法，通过严格训练的众包标注了2400张幻灯片。比较了多种大型语言模型和提示策略。

Result: AI模型识别设计缺陷的F1分数在0.331到0.655之间，利用分类法的提示策略表现最佳。修复研究中，82.0%的幻灯片显著改进。

Conclusion: SlideAudit数据集和分类法对自动化幻灯片评估和修复具有实用价值，但AI仍需改进。

Abstract: Automated evaluation of specific graphic designs like presentation slides is
an open problem. We present SlideAudit, a dataset for automated slide
evaluation. We collaborated with design experts to develop a thorough taxonomy
of slide design flaws. Our dataset comprises 2400 slides collected and
synthesized from multiple sources, including a subset intentionally modified
with specific design problems. We then fully annotated them using our taxonomy
through strictly trained crowdsourcing from Prolific. To evaluate whether AI is
capable of identifying design flaws, we compared multiple large language models
under different prompting strategies, and with an existing design critique
pipeline. We show that AI models struggle to accurately identify slide design
flaws, with F1 scores ranging from 0.331 to 0.655. Notably, prompting
techniques leveraging our taxonomy achieved the highest performance. We further
conducted a remediation study to assess AI's potential for improving slides.
Among 82.0% of slides that showed significant improvement, 87.8% of them were
improved more with our taxonomy, further demonstrating its utility.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了先进的多模态模型如何帮助盲人或视障人士（BVI）通过实时视频AI系统完成任务，发现其在静态场景中有效，但在动态场景中不足，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索实时视频AI系统对BVI人士在多样现实任务中的潜在益处与挑战。

Method: 对8名BVI参与者进行探索性研究，使用ChatGPT的Advanced Voice with Video系统在不同场景中完成任务。

Result: 系统在静态场景中表现良好，但在动态场景中描述不足；参与者利用视觉信息补充移动策略，但存在信任与安全问题。

Conclusion: 需增强实时感知能力、优化干预时机，并解决生态与安全问题以改进辅助视频AI系统。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have provided blind or
visually impaired (BVI) individuals with new capabilities to interpret and
engage with the real world through interactive systems that utilize live video
feeds. However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to
support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we
present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants.
Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live
video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating
objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor
environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively
provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in
delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite
inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the
provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although
the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions,
assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses,
and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential
risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for
assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing
capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing
beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI在知识密集型工作中如何影响用户的认知角色，提出了五种动态的认知关系类型，并呼吁更细致的框架来理解人机协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在知识密集型工作中的普及，研究其如何重塑用户的认知角色，填补了HCI研究中关于人机认知关系的空白。

Method: 通过对31位跨学科学者的访谈，开发了五部分编码手册，识别出五种认知关系类型。

Result: 发现了五种动态的认知关系类型，表明认知角色是情境依赖的。

Conclusion: 呼吁超越静态的AI隐喻，采用更细致的框架来理解人机如何共同构建知识。

Abstract: As AI systems become integral to knowledge-intensive work, questions arise
not only about their functionality but also their epistemic roles in human-AI
interaction. While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it
often overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This
study examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,
trust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31
interviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook
and identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent
Delegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic
Abstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and
human epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and
context-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a
more nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,
enriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI
use.
