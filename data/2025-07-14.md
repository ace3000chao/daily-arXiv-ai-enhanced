### [1] [RepeaTTS: Towards Feature Discovery through Repeated Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08012)
*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于提示的文本转语音模型，通过自然语言指令控制语音特征，但存在控制受限和输出不稳定的问题。通过主成分分析和二次微调，提高了模型的整体可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于提示的文本转语音模型在控制语音特征时存在的局限性（如训练时未暴露的特征无法控制）和输出不稳定问题。

Method: 利用主成分分析确定输出方差的主要潜在特征，并将其作为新标签进行二次微调。

Result: 在未包含情感披露的冰岛语音语料库模型上，该方法成功提取了连续和离散特征，提升了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 通过分析不可控方差并引入二次微调，有效提升了基于提示的文本转语音模型的控制能力。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedicalBERT是一种针对生物医学领域的预训练BERT模型，通过领域特定词汇和优化，显著提升了生物医学自然语言处理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练语言模型（如BERT、GPT）在生物医学领域因术语复杂性和双向理解需求表现不足，需针对性改进。

Method: 提出MedicalBERT，基于BERT架构，使用大规模生物医学数据集预训练，并优化微调以支持多种任务（如命名实体识别、关系提取等）。

Result: MedicalBERT在多个任务上优于BioBERT、SciBERT等模型，平均性能比通用BERT高5.67%。

Conclusion: MedicalBERT证明了预训练BERT模型在生物医学NLP中的潜力，强调了迁移学习在领域特定任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing
domain-specific information.

### [3] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，现实中的越狱攻击复杂度并未显著高于普通对话，且攻击毒性稳定，防御机制在改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（LLM）越狱策略的复杂性和演变对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 通过分析200多万条真实对话，使用概率度量、词汇多样性、压缩比和认知负荷指标等复杂度指标。

Result: 越狱尝试的复杂度与普通对话无显著差异，攻击毒性稳定，防御机制改进。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻防升级的叙事，指出越狱发展受限于人类创造力，同时强调学术披露可能带来的信息风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

### [4] [Assessing the Capabilities and Limitations of FinGPT Model in Financial NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08015)
*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中表现优异，尤其在分类任务（如情感分析和标题分类）上接近GPT-4，但在推理和生成任务（如问答和摘要）上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域的实际应用能力，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 在六个金融NLP任务上测试FinGPT，使用金融专用数据集，并与GPT-4和人类基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现优秀，但在推理和生成任务中表现不佳，数值准确性和复杂推理能力存在明显差距。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化架构和领域适应性，以提升综合能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

### [5] [Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017)
*Pierre Beckmann,Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部工作机制，提出了一个三层次的理解框架，并指出LLMs的认知架构与人类不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计的观点，探索其内部结构与功能类比的理解能力。

Method: 提出三层次理解框架：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解，并结合机制可解释性（MI）的研究发现。

Result: LLMs展现出类似理解的能力，但其认知架构与人类不同，需关注其独特工作机制。

Conclusion: 应转向研究LLMs的独特工作机制，而非争论其是否具备理解能力。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

### [6] [Review, Remask, Refine (R3): Process-Guided Block Diffusion for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08018)
*Nikita Mounier,Parsa Idehpour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3框架通过Review、Remask、Refine三步优化文本生成，无需额外训练，适用于预训练掩码文本扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型高效识别和纠正自身错误的挑战。

Method: 利用Process Reward Model（PRM）评估生成块，根据PRM分数动态调整掩码比例，针对性优化低分部分。

Result: 通过针对性优化，生成文本质量得到提升。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单有效的框架，能显著提升预训练模型的文本生成质量。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

### [7] [Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019)
*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在简历筛选中的行为一致性（信号）与随机性（噪声），并与人类专家表现对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs在自动化招聘系统中的表现及其与人类专家的差异，以指导实际应用。

Method: 使用控制数据集测试三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同上下文中的表现，并与三位人类招聘专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类专家评价存在显著不同；GPT对上下文适应性强，Gemini次之，Claude最弱。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释的模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎应用于自动化招聘。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

### [8] [Circumventing Safety Alignment in Large Language Models Through Embedding Space Toxicity Attenuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08020)
*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，成功攻击LLMs的安全对齐机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域取得成功，但其嵌入空间中毒攻击的安全风险未被充分研究，尤其是绕过安全对齐的针对性攻击。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换操作嵌入空间，无需微调或训练数据，即可绕过模型拒绝行为并保持语言连贯性。

Result: 在五个开源LLMs上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%，且在安全增强模型上表现良好（77.39% ASR）。

Conclusion: 当前对齐策略存在关键漏洞，需开发嵌入感知的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

### [9] [Unveiling Effective In-Context Configurations for Image Captioning: An External & Internal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08021)
*Li Li,Yongliang Wu,Jingze Zhu,Jiawei Peng,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过外部和内部实验全面研究了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在图像描述任务中的应用，探索了演示配置策略和模型行为特征，并提出了新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLM）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMM），但多模态ICL的演示配置和可控性研究仍处于初步阶段。

Method: 通过外部实验（如演示配置策略）和内部实验（如注意力特征分析）结合，提出新指标评估模型行为，并进行辅助实验探索模型加速和压缩的可行性。

Result: 揭示了ICEs配置策略对模型性能的影响，发现了典型注意力模式，并从预训练数据特征角度解释了模型性能差异。

Conclusion: 研究为理解多模态ICL提供了双重视角，提出的方法和指标可应用于更广泛的研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

### [10] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多数商业大语言模型（LLM）在伦理和政治回应中表现出一致的自由主义倾向，主要源于训练数据、强化学习、学术伦理框架和安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs政治倾向的成因及其影响，区分政治偏见与合理认知差异。

Method: 采用多方法分析七种主流LLMs，包括道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数。

Result: 多数模型优先体现自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调会增强自由主义倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs的自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映集体推理的新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

### [11] [Better Together: Quantifying the Benefits of AI-Assisted Recruitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08029)
*Ada Aka,Emil Palikot,Ali Ansari,Nima Yazdani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI辅助招聘显著提高了候选人通过最终面试的概率（54% vs 34%），并增加了其后续就业机会（23% vs 18%），但倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的候选人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响，填补实证研究的空白。

Method: 随机分配37,000名初级开发者职位申请者至传统招聘流程或AI辅助流程，比较最终面试通过率和后续就业情况。

Result: AI辅助流程通过率提高20个百分点，后续就业率提高5.9个百分点，但偏向年轻、经验少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI在招聘中提升了效率和候选人质量，但也可能引入偏见，需关注其选择标准。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

### [12] [A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030)
*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了2022至2025年间生成式AI模型（LLM和VLM）在医学图像和临床问题回答中免责声明的使用情况，发现免责声明比例显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI模型在医学领域的应用增加，其输出可能包含不准确信息，免责声明作为安全措施的重要性凸显。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛查模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: LLM和VLM的免责声明比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力提升，免责声明需根据临床背景调整，以确保安全使用。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

*Hong Jia,Shiya Fu,Vassilis Kostakos,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在心理健康理解任务中表现接近大型语言模型（LLMs），尤其在二分类任务中仅相差2%。尽管参数少得多，SLMs通过小样本学习显著提升性能，展现了隐私保护潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SLMs在敏感应用（如心理健康）中的理解能力，探讨其作为隐私保护工具的可行性。

Method: 通过零样本和小样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多分类任务中性能下降相似。小样本学习显著提升SLMs性能（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，尤其适合隐私敏感的数据分析和小样本快速适应场景。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

TL;DR: 提出了一种框架，通过集成外部工具增强LLMs在查询中的能力，显著提升教育场景中的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs因缺乏上下文信息导致回答质量差或产生幻觉的问题。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过访问外部API获取额外信息，并集成计算工具（如计算器、日历）。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上测试，数学推理准确率达83%，科学推理达88%，优于GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统提供了可能，支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用、挑战和差距，以促进其更好地服务于医疗实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述（68篇）和临床医生调查（50人）的双重方法。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图、多分辨率成像等关键功能，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者上下文和评估方法不匹配等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设LLM仅通过少样本提示即可生成有效计划，但实际效果有限，需要更强推理能力。

Method: 引入CRISP数据集，自动生成并验证高复杂度计划，通过微调小模型生成高质量计划。

Result: 微调后的小模型生成计划质量优于大模型少样本提示和CoT推理，且跨领域泛化能力强。

Conclusion: CRISP证明了通过微调小模型提升计划生成能力的有效性，并展示了跨领域泛化的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Motivation: 为了支持或自动化科学研究中的消融实验设计，作者提出了AblationBench，以评估语言模型代理在此类任务中的能力。

Method: AblationBench包含两个任务：AuthorAblation（基于方法部分提出消融实验）和ReviewerAblation（在完整论文中找出缺失的消融实验）。作者开发了基于语言模型的自动评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前最先进的语言模型在这些任务上表现不佳，平均仅能识别29%的原始消融实验。

Conclusion: 研究发现，链式思维提示优于现有的基于代理的方法，但当前语言模型在消融实验规划任务中仍有局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul是一种多轮LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮对话中KV缓存恢复的效率问题，避免固定压缩策略导致的准确性下降。

Method: 动态选择压缩策略、预选策略选择器、注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: TTFT减少1.5x-2.68x，KV缓存存储减少1.33x-2.35x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul在多轮对话中高效且准确地恢复了KV缓存，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对语言模型进行微调的需求。

Method: 使用大语言模型策略性执行SPARQL查询并搜索知识图谱中的相关IRI和字面量。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零样本设置的SOTA结果，在Freebase上接近最佳少样本方法，其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种知识图谱和基准测试中表现优异，支持零样本和少样本设置。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Motivation: 解决语言模型在现实应用中面临的安全性、可解释性和偏见问题，实现透明和可审计的使用。

Method: 开发了一个声明静态类型语言模型子程序的框架，记录所有模型生成的工件，并通过稀疏的人类反馈在线优化性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为语言模型的负责任使用提供了可行方案，尤其在需要透明和审计的领域（如医疗和法律）具有潜力。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、与查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，显著减少内存负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长上下文生成中KV缓存内存需求高的问题，以提高吞吐量和降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，实现KV缓存压缩，并引入上下文校准压缩技术。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，Compactor保留一半令牌且性能不变，KV内存负担平均减少63%。

Conclusion: Compactor在多种任务和模型上表现优异，是一种高效且通用的KV缓存压缩方案。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从大型语言模型（LLM）到小型语言模型（SLM）的知识蒸馏方法，特别关注保留共情能力，通过两步微调过程和针对性提示显著提升了SLM的共情表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限但需要频繁人机交互的场景（如智能手机）中，小型语言模型（SLM）需要保留大型语言模型（LLM）的共情能力。

Method: 采用两步微调过程，利用从LLM提取的共情对话数据集，并设计了四组针对性提示以优化共情蒸馏。

Result: 经过优化的SLM在生成共情回应上的胜率达到90%，针对性提示比基础直接提示提升了10%的胜率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为资源受限场景下的语言模型应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Result: 在TriviaQA、GSM8K和FactScore-Bio数据集上评估了代表性方法。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为真实性预测研究提供了灵活且全面的工具，支持未来扩展。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调LLMs时，LoRA技术通过添加恒定导向向量实现跨领域泛化，解释了OOCR现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调后为何能表现出超出上下文的推理能力（OOCR），以提升其安全性和可靠性。

Method: 通过LoRA微调添加恒定导向向量，并直接从零训练导向向量，验证其对OOCR的影响。

Result: 恒定导向向量能显著提升任务性能并引发跨领域泛化，甚至适用于条件行为任务（如模型后门）。

Conclusion: OOCR现象可通过恒定导向向量解释，为LLMs的安全可靠部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Result: 强模型普遍优于学生平均水平，弱模型可能偶然对齐；提示调整模型表现，但无模型-提示组合能全面匹配各年级和科目。

Conclusion: 需开发新的训练和评估策略，并提供了基于研究结果的代理选择指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，token使用减少30%，并成功部署于实际开发环境。

Conclusion: AutoThink范式具有可扩展性，未来200B MoE模型有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Method: SSR范式通过让模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效减轻灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和DIMT任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能同时提升模型的多语言翻译和OCR能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

TL;DR: MK2是一种基于提示的管道方法，通过迭代优化提示生成专利产品创意，无需额外训练数据，在多个领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从专利中快速生成商业可行产品创意的需求，避免额外训练数据的依赖。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5迭代优化提示，GPT-4.1生成创意，Qwen3-8B通过Elo循环选择最佳提示。

Result: 在三个领域中表现优异，自动排行榜领先，赢得36次测试中的25次。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程已能生成具有商业价值的创意，但某些领域需更深入的专业知识。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练文本重排序器中的效果，发现知识蒸馏在有大模型教师时表现更优，否则对比学习更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要明确对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练交叉编码器重排序器时的实际效果差异。

Method: 通过在同一数据上训练不同大小和架构的重排序器，并使用强对比学习模型作为教师进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 知识蒸馏在大模型教师时表现优于对比学习，但教师模型容量相同时无优势。

Conclusion: 建议在有强大教师模型时使用知识蒸馏，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统探索如何充分释放LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的性能潜力。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估不同方法对金融问答任务的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，传统方法对其提升有限；多语言对齐方法对RLLMs效果不明显。

Conclusion: 研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如ROUGE）在英语中表现良好，但在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确，因此需要系统性评估。

Method: 设计了一个大规模评估套件，涵盖八种语言，分析指标与人工评估的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中表现较差，而神经网络指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中存在局限性，建议推广基于神经网络的评估指标。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Result: 微调模型自身认为可信的生成数据比使用人工标注数据更能提升生成文本的事实性，且这一效果在不同领域均适用。

Conclusion: 模型自身的判断可以作为提升生成文本事实性的有效信号。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现了新的最优性能，确保内部逻辑一致性。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统在模拟群体决策过程中具有潜力，可支持跨领域的专家决策工作坊。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose

comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Method: 通过微调和RAG方法，对教科书案例和税务咨询公司的实际案例进行实验，评估LLMs的法律推理能力。

Result: LLMs在适当配置下能有效支持税务专业人员，提供法律依据，但当前原型尚无法完全自动化，仍需处理隐性客户知识和上下文特定文档。

Conclusion: LLMs在税务咨询中具有潜力，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以实现更广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the

*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将大型语言模型（LLMs）与潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）结合的效果，发现LLM引导的初始化对LDA收敛无影响，但后校正显著提升了5.86%的连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能提升LDA在文本挖掘中的性能，特别是在初始化和后校正阶段。

Method: 在LDA的初始化和后校正阶段集成LLMs，通过实验评估LLM引导的初始化对Gibbs采样算法的影响，以及后校正的效果。

Result: LLM引导的初始化对LDA收敛无影响且表现最差，但后校正显著提升了5.86%的连贯性。

Conclusion: LLMs在LDA后校正阶段有实际益处，但并非在所有文本挖掘任务中都是最优选择。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Conclusion: 框架为多语言情感检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中常使用ASR生成的错误转录，而非人工转录，需评估其对说话人归属任务的影响。

Method: 首次全面研究ASR转录错误对说话人归属性能的影响，分析转录错误和ASR系统特性如何影响归属。

Result: 说话人归属对单词级转录错误具有较强鲁棒性，且恢复真实转录的目标与归属性能相关性极低。

Conclusion: ASR生成的错误转录在说话人归属任务中表现优异，可能因错误揭示了说话人特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

TL;DR: KELPS框架通过神经符号方法将非正式数学转化为机器可验证定理，解决了多语言平行语料库的瓶颈问题，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在形式化非正式数学时因多语言平行语料库数量和质量限制而面临的瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出KELPS框架，通过翻译、合成和过滤非正式数据为多种形式语言（Lean、Coq、Isabelle），使用知识方程（KEs）作为中间语言。

Result: 生成了超过60,000个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: KELPS框架在形式化数学任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需参数更新的知识图谱增强框架（KGA），通过动态知识融合提升大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强方法依赖参数微调，易导致灾难性遗忘和泛化能力下降，且难以适应实时知识更新。

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导注意力模块（KGA），包含外向和内向两条路径，动态融合外部知识并过滤无关信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异性能，支持实时知识融合。

Conclusion: KGA框架有效解决了静态知识融合的局限性，无需参数更新即可实现动态知识增强。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Method: 开发了MM-Coder，结合视觉工作流（Visual Workflow）和文本指令，并构建了MMc-Instruct数据集和MMEval评估基准。

Result: MM-Coder在代码生成中表现出色，但模型在精确捕捉视觉信息、遵循指令和高级编程知识方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder为工业编程带来革新，使LLMs能够通过文本和视觉设计理解和实现复杂规范。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理任务中提升了模型推理的质与量，且超参数稳定、推理效率高。

Conclusion: 缓存引导是一种更稳健、实用的控制生成方法，优于传统技术。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and

table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the

Result: 紫色代理能主动模拟攻击轨迹并干预，为分析对抗动态和降低越狱风险提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM越狱攻防提供了系统化解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Motivation: 研究LLM在决策中的有限理性行为，探索认知约束和思维表达对战略互动的影响。

Method: 提出LLM-Nash框架，将推理提示作为策略空间，通过LLM推理生成行为，定义推理均衡。

Result: 推理均衡与传统纳什均衡存在差异，为LLM系统战略互动提供新理论基础。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为研究LLM驱动的有限理性战略互动提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 通过参数化接地方法，实现了表达能力和可扩展性的灵活权衡，为神经符号推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态量子联邦学习（QFL）方法，通过量子纠缠实现中间融合，并引入缺失模态无关（MMA）机制以解决模态缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QFL框架多为单模态，难以应对现实任务中的多模态需求，且模态缺失会降低模型性能。

Method: 采用量子纠缠的中间融合方法，并设计MMA机制隔离未训练的量子电路。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态QFL结合MMA机制显著提升了性能，解决了模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在理论和计算系统中的表现，尤其是其在生成创造性假设方面的不足。

Method: 回顾溯因推理在认识论、科学和设计中的讨论，分析计算系统的实现方式。

Result: 理论和计算系统均未能充分支持创造性溯因假设的生成。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究应关注如何改进计算系统以支持创造性溯因推理。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的安全对齐框架，用于处理使用工具的LLM代理的安全风险，包括用户和工具引发的威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着能够使用工具的自主LLM代理的出现，传统对话滥用之外的安全风险增加，需要一种新的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于结构化推理和沙盒强化学习的框架，包括三模态分类和政策驱动决策模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐的代理显著提高了对安全威胁的抵抗能力，同时保持了在良性任务上的高效性。

Conclusion: 安全与有效性可以共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出M2-Reasoning-7B模型，结合高质量数据生成（294.2K样本）和动态多任务训练策略（包括任务特定奖励）。

Result: 模型在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，尤其在通用和空间推理领域表现卓越。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，显著提升了MLLMs的动态空间交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种在多智能体LLM环境中引入伦理倡导代理的框架，用于自动生成伦理需求草案，并通过案例研究验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于时间和资源限制，手动获取伦理需求具有挑战性且优先级低，因此需要一种自动化方法。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过伦理倡导代理在多智能体LLM环境中对系统描述进行伦理批判和输入，生成伦理需求草案。

Result: 案例研究表明，该框架能捕捉大部分研究人员在30分钟访谈中识别的伦理需求，并引入额外相关需求，但也存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于在需求工程中更广泛地采用伦理考量，但需结合人类反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层框架，通过任务抽象和逻辑生成两阶段将自然语言映射为逻辑表示，显著提升了推理准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入的结构化推理问题，弥合非结构化语言表达与形式逻辑表示之间的差距。

Method: 采用双层框架：高层任务抽象（LLM解析自然语言为结构化表示）和低层逻辑生成（LLM生成符号化工作流或可执行程序）。通过端到端双层优化联合优化两阶段。

Result: 在多个现实推理基准测试中，准确率显著优于基线，最高提升40%。

Conclusion: 双层设计提升了透明度和错误可追溯性，为LLM的可信和系统性推理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多粒度稀疏激活和分层知识图谱的框架，用于提升罕见病诊断的准确性和信息质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断因知识表示深度不足、概念理解有限和临床推理受限而进展缓慢。

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医学概念，结合分层知识图谱（分类、临床特征、实例），并辅以四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。专家评估显示信息质量、推理和专业表达均有改进。

Conclusion: 该方法缩短了罕见病患者的“诊断旅程”，接近临床阈值（0.90）。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

<details>

Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考的生物样本记录问题，传统方法耗时且现有自动化工具未充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用多模态大模型（LMM）和网格化方法，在零样本设置下视觉化空间关系。

Result: 实验显示，该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: 多模态大模型能有效理解细粒度地图，提出了将其整合到地理参考工作流程的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量语音指令数据集提供了高效且不依赖人工标注的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

TL;DR: 论文评估了结构化多智能体系统（MAS）在早期工程设计中是否比双智能体系统（2AS）更有效地管理需求提取、功能分解和模拟代码生成。结果显示，MAS在生成更细粒度的设计状态图（DSG）方面表现更好，但需求覆盖率和代码兼容性仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计涉及复杂的迭代推理，现有的大语言模型（LLM）工作流难以保持任务连续性并生成可执行模型。研究旨在探索多智能体系统是否能更有效地支持设计过程。

Method: 通过九角色MAS和双角色2AS对比实验，使用两种LLM（Llama 3.3 70B和DeepSeek R1 70B）在不同配置下运行60次实验，评估JSON有效性、需求覆盖率等指标。

Result: MAS生成的设计状态图更细粒度（平均5-6个节点），但需求覆盖率低（小于20%）。代码兼容性在2AS特定设置下可达100%，但MAS平均低于50%。DeepSeek R1 70B能可靠标记工作流完成。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体系统能增强设计细节，但需求覆盖率和代码兼容性仍需改进。推理蒸馏的LLM提高了完成率，但低需求和代码保真度问题仍然存在。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步改进模型性能，通过验证器反馈使模型能够自我感知推理过程的正确性并纠正错误。

Method: 采用验证器反馈的强化学习，结合反馈令牌掩码和多轮验证器交互，优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升了3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其固有缺陷和高推理成本，需要一种更高效的推理框架。

Method: 设计了INoT框架，通过LLM-Read代码提示实现程序化对话推理，使反思过程在LLM内部完成。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%，并验证了其在图像任务中的通用性。

Conclusion: INoT显著提升了AI代理的推理效率和性能，同时降低了成本，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated
approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including
increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization
utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.

TL;DR: 研究比较了大型语言模型（LLM）与传统人工方法在心理健康访谈主题分析中的表现，发现LLM更具成本效益但深度不足，需结合人工监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主题分析在大型医疗研究中资源密集的问题，探索LLM在心理健康访谈中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用GPT-4o模型和RISEN提示框架，与传统人工分析（Dedoose）对比，评估代码开发、饱和点和主题合成。

Result: LLM在演绎代码开发上接近人工，但归纳代码和主题合成较弱；知识库LLM饱和更快，但人工分析更深入。

Conclusion: LLM可提升心理健康研究的定性分析效率，但需结合人工监督以确保深度和参与者视角的平衡。

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文贡献了一个全面的数据集，用于研究用户在搜索引擎结果页（SERP）上的注意力和购买行为。通过眼动仪获取客观的视觉注意力数据，弥补了以往依赖鼠标移动和自我报告标签的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究依赖鼠标移动和自我报告标签作为行为代理，但存在不准确和偏差问题。本文旨在通过眼动仪提供更客观的视觉注意力数据。

Method: 使用眼动仪构建连续视觉注意力的客观真实数据，数据集包含2,776个交易查询，来自47名参与者，涵盖HTML源文件、渲染截图、眼动和鼠标移动数据等。

Result: 提供了数据集的详细描述和基线实验（分类任务），为未来研究提供了多种可能性。

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究用户行为和注意力提供了更客观的基础，并激发了未来研究的灵感。

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing
behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on
mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied
on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be
inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye
tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention.
Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected
from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images;
(2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data;
(5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6)
scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an
overview of the dataset and baseline experiments (classification tasks) that
can inspire researchers about the different possibilities for future work.

Conclusion: 该方法在人类-计算机交互、康复医学和运动控制研究中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解老年人的认知和情感状态对其健康至关重要，尤其是在医院和养老环境中。研究旨在探索一种非侵入性的情绪识别方法，避免使用摄像头或面部分析。

Method: 使用Empatica E4和Shimmer3 GSR+腕带获取生理信号，结合iMotion的FEA模块记录面部表情。通过经典机器学习模型预测情绪强度。

Result: 在回归任务中取得了最高0.782的r2分数和最低0.0006的MSE，验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法对ADRD患者和PTSD退伍军人等有重要意义，为隐私保护且高效的情绪识别系统提供了可能。

Abstract: Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their
cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living
environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive
approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals
obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older
individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from
the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were
recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial
Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion
categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion
recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without
the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging
classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional
responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2
score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has
significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical
regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for
privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world
settings.

the uncanny valley effect. Using a qualitative approach, we analyzed
discussions from the r/autism community on Reddit to explore how autistic
participants/participants with autism describe their experiences with
AI-generated faces and the uncanny valley phenomenon. The findings suggest that
autistic people/people with autism may experience the uncanny valley
differently, often reporting stronger discomfort with real human faces than
with artificial ones. This research contributes to our understanding of visual
perception in autism and has implications for the development of inclusive AI
systems and assistive technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预定义步骤的AI链式调用限制了自由探索，而基于认知过程的图形化系统旨在解决这一问题，促进创意探索。

Method: 采用节点式设计，支持可重用、可共享的模板，结合创意研究中的认知过程。

Result: 小规模用户研究表明，图形化系统比对话式界面更支持创意构思和写作过程的可视化。

Conclusion: 图形化系统虽复杂，但对能有效使用的用户提供了更高的创意支持，同时也指出了系统的局限性。

Abstract: We present a graphical, node-based system through which users can visually
chain generative AI models for creative tasks. Research in the area of chaining
LLMs has found that while chaining provides transparency, controllability and
guardrails to approach certain tasks, chaining with pre-defined LLM steps
prevents free exploration. Using cognitive processes from creativity research
as a basis, we create a system that addresses the inherent constraints of
chat-based AI interactions. Specifically, our system aims to overcome the
limiting linear structure that inhibits creative exploration and ideation.
Further, our node-based approach enables the creation of reusable, shareable
templates that can address different creative tasks. In a small-scale user
study, we find that our graph-based system supports ideation and allows some
users to better visualise and think through their writing process when compared
to a similar conversational interface. We further discuss the weaknesses and
limitations of our system, noting the benefits to creativity that user
interfaces with higher complexity can provide for users who can effectively use
them.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS)
framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home
rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,
including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for
machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is
demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement
(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A
smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual
and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted
to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for
further use and customization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 久坐是健康风险，需探索有效的干预策略以减少久坐行为。

Method: 采用混合设计实验，15名大学生参与，测试三种干预方法（无干预、推送通知、灯光调暗）和三种任务情境（电脑工作、视频通话、阅读）。

Result: 灯光调暗比推送通知略有效（1.4 vs 1.2次站立），但66.7%参与者感到不适；推送通知仅20%不适。效果因任务情境而异。

Conclusion: 适应性轻推系统应根据情境和个人偏好定制干预措施。

Abstract: Prolonged sitting is a health risk leading to metabolic and cardiovascular
diseases. To combat this, various "nudging" strategies encourage stand-ups.
Behavior change triggers use explicit prompts such as smartphone push
notifications or light controls. However, comparisons of the effects of such
interactions, discomfort, and user context have not yet been performed. The
present study evaluated these methods in a mixed design experiment with 15
college students. Three intervention methods (none, push notifications, and
light dimming) and three user task contexts (computer work, video calls, and
reading) were tested. The frequency of standing up and comfort were assessed
after each ten-minute session. Results showed that dimming resulted in slightly
more breaks (1.4 \pm 1.55) than push notification (1.2 \pm 1.08), but caused
discomfort for 66.7% of participants, compared to 20% for notification. The
results were influenced by task context. Dimming was most effective during
video calls and reading, while push notifications were more effective during
computer work. These findings suggest adaptive nudging systems should tailor
interventions based on context and individual preferences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦少样本学习框架，结合隐私保护机制，解决呼吸疾病诊断中数据标注不足和隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注的劳动密集性导致高质量标注数据稀缺，且患者隐私问题限制了数据共享，现有方法难以兼顾数据隐私和诊断效果。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法减少过拟合，引入差分隐私噪声保护梯度，使用加权平均算法聚合本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保护隐私的同时，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在数据稀缺和隐私保护场景下具有显著优势，适用于呼吸疾病诊断。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPE在组合优化领域尚未被充分研究，而组合优化在化学和生物学等领域有重要应用。因此，本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种高效的组合优化算法。

Method: 首先泛化了TPE中的分类核与数值核，引入距离结构；随后讨论了针对大规模组合搜索空间的核修改，降低了时间复杂度。

Result: 在合成问题实验中，提出的方法比原始TPE以更少的评估次数找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在Optuna中可用，为组合优化问题提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，能够从点式绝对奖励中学习，同时保持DPO类方法的简单性和离线适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如PPO和GRPO需要在线、策略算法，而DPO和REBEL只能从偏好对或相对信号中学习。QRPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: QRPO利用分位数奖励，通过回归到KL正则化RL目标的闭式解来学习。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优异，优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO。

Conclusion: QRPO不仅性能优越，还能减少长度偏差，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型基础模型微调时的内存挑战，避免固定子空间或计算成本高的离线重采样问题。

Method: 使用动态更新的低秩SVD表示一阶动量，实现自适应优化子空间更新，并进行频谱归一化更新。

Result: 在大型语言模型对齐基准测试中表现优异，内存减少与LoRA相当，性能优于现有低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD提供了一种内存高效且性能优越的微调方法，理论收敛性得到保证。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off

### [92] [PDE-aware Optimizer for Physics-informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08118)
*Hardik Shukla,Manurag Khullar,Vismay Churiwala*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于PDE残差梯度方差的优化器，用于改进PINNs训练中的梯度对齐问题，相比Adam和SOAP表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在处理PINNs中的PDE约束时难以平衡损失项，尤其是在刚性或病态系统中。

Method: 提出了一种PDE感知优化器，通过调整参数更新以适应PDE残差梯度的方差，避免二阶优化器的高计算成本。

Result: 在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上测试，PDE感知优化器实现了更平滑的收敛和更低的绝对误差。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知的自适应性有效提升了PINNs训练的稳定性，但未来需研究其在更大架构和硬件加速器上的扩展性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Motivation: 物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在求解偏微分方程（PDEs）时性能受采样点影响较大，而准蒙特卡洛方法在高维问题中表现优异，因此提出QRPINNs以改进采样策略。

Method: QRPINNs采用低差异序列替代随机采样点，理论上具有更快的收敛速度，并结合自适应采样进一步提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，QRPINNs在高维PDEs中显著优于传统PINNs和自适应采样方法。

Conclusion: QRPINNs通过改进采样策略，显著提升了物理信息神经网络的性能，尤其是在高维问题中，且结合自适应采样可进一步优化。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

TL;DR: KKT-Hardnet是一种改进的PINN架构，通过KKT条件严格满足约束，提高了模型预测的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN无法严格满足约束条件，这在工程系统中可能导致预测可靠性下降。

Method: 利用KKT条件进行投影，并通过对数-指数变换重新构造非线性KKT条件，形成可微分的稀疏系统。

Result: 在测试问题和实际化学过程模拟中，KKT-Hardnet比传统PINN和多层感知机表现更优。

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet通过严格约束满足，为复杂系统的混合建模提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM在大型城市风险预测中表现优异，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Result: 量子增强SVM在所有情绪类别中表现更优，F1分数超80%，召回率提升36%。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据，为临床和辅助生活场景提供无干扰情绪监测基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living
conditions.

Conclusion: 论文为可扩展、自适应、可解释的异常检测系统奠定了基础，并呼吁在网络安全研究中转向因果驱动方法。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Motivation: 传统思维链方法依赖启发式采样，缺乏对推理转移的结构化建模，限制了推理轨迹的多样性和有效性。

Method: 提出CTRLS框架，将推理建模为带有隐状态转移的MDP，利用分布强化学习进行探索，并引入熵正则化和epsilon-greedy策略优化推理。

Result: 实验显示在基准推理任务中，推理准确性、多样性和探索效率均有提升。

Conclusion: CTRLS通过结构化建模和强化学习，显著提升了思维链推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，将离散优化问题松弛为连续空间，导致解远离最优且无法适应不可微目标。

Method: 通过进化算法直接解决离散优化问题，支持黑盒模型和任意目标，无需可微代理损失。

Result: 实验显示EvA平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并设计了两种新攻击。

Conclusion: EvA揭示了攻击设计的未开发潜力，适用于不可微目标和黑盒模型。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Conclusion: 因果发现与LLM结合能有效辅助诊断能源效率问题。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Conclusion: 基于物理粒子相互作用的新方法为生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 该方法在严格无泄漏的AI数学奥林匹克竞赛（AIMO）中表现优异，为开发高性能数学推理模型提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

training configurations at

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Clustering is a critical component of decision-making in todays data-driven
environments. It has been widely used in a variety of fields such as
bioinformatics, social network analysis, and image processing. However,
clustering accuracy remains a major challenge in large datasets. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of strategies for selecting the optimal value
of k in clustering, with a focus on achieving a balance between clustering
precision and computational efficiency in complex data environments. In
addition, this paper introduces improvements to clustering techniques for text
and image data to provide insights into better computational performance and

method, along with statistical methods such as Local Structures, Gap
Statistics, Class Consistency Ratio, and a Cluster Overlap Index CCR and
COIbased algorithm to calculate the best value of k for K-Means clustering. The
results of comparative experiments show that the proposed approach achieves up
to 99 percent faster execution times on high-dimensional datasets while
retaining both precision and scalability, making it highly suitable for real
time clustering needs or scenarios demanding efficient clustering with minimal
resource utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络和深度学习模型在处理高维动态工作负载时效率低下，主要因其仅依赖参数调整。

Method: 结合量子计算和结构优化，提出CA-QNN模型，将工作负载数据转换为量子位，并通过量子神经元处理。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，CA-QNN的预测误差比现有方法降低了93.40%和91.27%。

Conclusion: CA-QNN在动态云服务的工作负载预测中表现出卓越的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM通过整合外部知识，显著提升了单细胞数据分析的性能和可解释性，有助于揭示生物学机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该方法为加速BPMN模型创建提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Result: Transformer网络表现最优，准确率在82.79%至96.73%之间，且不易过拟合。

Conclusion: Transformer网络在预测变道意图方面具有优势，为自动驾驶运动规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著降低I类错误率，优于传统两样本检验方法。

Conclusion: 两簇检验方法在可解释聚类和层次聚类中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Conclusion: OPT有效解决了离线预训练智能体在线微调的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Conclusion: RSS-MLP通过有序采样减少方差，显著提升了MLP的性能，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，选择需根据具体需求权衡速度、损失和下游性能。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

TL;DR: SynBridge是一种基于双向流的生成模型，用于多任务反应预测，通过图到图变换和离散流桥技术，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分布和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突然的，如原子电荷状态的变化或化学键的形成与断裂。

Method: 提出SynBridge模型，利用图到图变换网络架构和离散流桥技术，捕捉反应物和产物之间通过键和原子离散状态的双向化学转化。

Result: 在USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT和Pistachio三个基准数据集上，SynBridge在正向和逆向合成任务中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结构化扩散在离散空间中对反应预测具有显著优势，SynBridge为化学反应的建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

TL;DR: SFedKD通过多教师知识蒸馏解决顺序联邦学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顺序联邦学习（SFL）在数据异构环境下表现出灾难性遗忘问题，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏，基于类别分布差异分配权重，并设计教师选择机制以减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明SFedKD有效缓解灾难性遗忘，性能优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD为SFL提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了模型训练效果。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Motivation: 在强化学习中，复杂目标的行为对齐通常需要精心设计奖励函数，这具有挑战性。

Method: 引入马尔可夫决策过程的代数视角，展示贝尔曼方程如何自然地从奖励的递归生成与聚合中产生，推广标准折扣和到其他递归聚合形式。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化多样目标，适用于确定性和随机环境，并与值函数和行动者-评论家算法无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了灵活性和实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有circRNA识别方法依赖RNA-seq数据，计算成本高且效率低，无法直接从基因组DNA预测circRNA，尤其在植物中因缺乏典型剪接位点而更具挑战性。

Method: 提出CircFormerMoE框架，包含剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务，基于Transformer和混合专家模型。

Result: 在10种植物基因数据上验证了模型有效性，能够发现未注释的circRNA，并通过可解释性分析揭示了预测相关的序列模式。

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的计算方法和工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上，预测误差分别降低了4.8%和31.2%，尤其在高风险场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的风险感知预测，有助于增强自动驾驶系统的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种无需增加参数或数据量的方法，通过递归和动态计算资源分配提升Transformer性能。

Method: 提出Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE)，在潜在空间进行迭代，仅需2次训练迭代即可实现测试时的泛化。

Result: AbbIE在零样本学习任务中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，且能动态调整计算复杂度。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新途径，尤其在计算资源动态分配方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Result: 在五个不同的恶意软件检测数据集上实验表明，ADAPT方法一致优于基线模型和竞争基准。

Conclusion: ADAPT为机器学习模型在恶意软件检测中更有效地适应概念漂移提供了新途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，而可持续灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD）可显著减少用水量。然而，缺乏相关数据阻碍了政策制定和资源分配。

Method: 研究结合地面真实数据和Sentinel-1卫星图像，开发了一个分类系统，用于区分不同的灌溉实践。

Result: 该方法在区分DSR与传统水稻种植方面达到78%的F1分数，并在旁遮普地区成功应用于300万块农田的测绘。

Conclusion: 该框架为政策制定者提供了监测可持续灌溉实践的工具，有助于目标干预和评估项目效果。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Motivation: 现有标注数据集已被用于训练大型视觉语言模型（VLMs），改进性能具有挑战性，因此探索无监督图像描述方法。

Method: 使用两个智能体（'speaker'和'listener'）在合作共同奖励设置下训练，采用GRPO算法。

Result: 使用预训练VLMs和LLM时，BLEU得分达46，优于基线模型；轻量级组件下BLEU得分为31，优于现有无监督方法。

Conclusion: LoGIC方法在无监督图像描述任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略不平衡协变量偏移这一复杂异质性，FedAKD旨在平衡预测准确性与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD包括客户端和服务器更新：客户端使用异步知识蒸馏策略，服务器聚合模型并更新全局模型。

Result: 实验表明FedAKD显著提升协作公平性、预测准确性，并促进客户端参与。

Conclusion: FedAKD是解决联邦学习中不平衡协变量偏移的有效方法，兼具理论与实验支持。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长序列上计算成本高的问题，提出一种高效的线性复杂度注意力机制。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，选择性关注数据的有信息尺度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少计算时间和资源消耗，同时提高准确性。

Conclusion: WERSA为长上下文模型提供了更实用、经济的解决方案，支持可持续和可扩展的AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Conclusion: 通过知识融合与蒸馏，实现了训练和推理复杂度的双赢，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI

Conclusion: SPLASH填补了逆强化学习在次优演示和复杂任务中的不足，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

TL;DR: PMD框架结合两种正则化技术，通过大规模实验分析其相互作用，发现精确组合对性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PMD框架中两种正则化技术的相互作用，填补实证研究的空白。

Method: 在小型RL环境中运行超过50万次训练种子，分析距离项和MDP正则化的组合效果。

Result: 两种正则化技术可部分替代，但精确组合对实现稳健性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果对开发更稳健的RL算法，尤其是超参数敏感性方面具有指导意义。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合测试时适应（TTA）和风险监控框架的方法，以检测模型性能下降的临界点，并在无标签测试数据的情况下实现统计风险监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在测试时遇到数据偏移是预测模型部署中的常见挑战，TTA方法虽能暂时适应，但模型最终可能失效，需要离线重新训练。

Method: 扩展了基于序列测试和置信序列的现有监控工具，使其适用于模型在测试时更新且无标签数据的情况。

Result: 在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中验证了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的TTA监控框架为模型性能下降提供了统计严谨的监控手段，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘导致新任务学习时旧任务性能下降，现有方法（如正则化）试图约束重要参数，但效果有限。

Method: 提出在训练最后阶段（平台期）跟踪参数活跃性，高活跃性参数指示损失函数平坦方向，适合适应新任务同时保留旧知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在缓解灾难性遗忘和新任务性能之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过关注训练最后阶段的参数活跃性，能更有效地解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习多层感知机（MLP）的自适应NVAR模型，提升了预测精度和噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NVAR和RC方法依赖固定的非线性结构，难以适应高噪声或高维数据，且计算成本高。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和浅层MLP，通过梯度优化联合训练，避免复杂的参数搜索。

Result: 在混沌系统中，自适应模型在预测精度和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动的非线性学习，简化了调参过程，提升了性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Motivation: 扩展量子傅里叶神经算子（QFNO）的能力，使其适用于更高维度的科学机器学习问题，并通过量子-经典混合计算提升性能和稳定性。

Method: 将傅里叶算子计算分区到经典和量子资源上，采用单热编码将输入数据编码为量子态，并通过变分方案优化量子电路参数。使用PennyLane和PyTorch实现，并在Burgers方程和Navier-Stokes方程上进行评估。

Result: PHQFNO在Burgers方程上达到经典FNO的精度，在不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上表现更优，且在输入噪声下显示出更高的稳定性。

Conclusion: PHQFNO通过量子-经典混合计算，在科学机器学习中实现了更高的精度和稳定性，为量子计算在复杂问题中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

Method: 利用Koopman嵌入发现潜在状态表示，构建条件高斯系统，通过解析公式高效评估后验分布。

Result: 在多个非线性PDE问题中，CGKN在状态预测和数据同化方面表现优异，与现有SciML方法相当。

Conclusion: CGKN框架展示了科学机器学习与数据同化的统一，为其他外环应用（如优化设计和控制）提供了范例。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Motivation: 符号加速器在基因组学、NLP和网络安全等领域应用广泛，但面临内存使用和路由复杂性的扩展性问题。

Method: AutoSlim利用随机森林分类器基于边分数和结构特征修剪低影响力转换，实现自动化的加权转换简化。

Result: 在NAPOLY+上评估，AutoSlim减少了40%的FPGA LUTs和30%的转换，且能扩展到比现有基准大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过修剪有效缓解了硬件资源爆炸问题，同时展示了硬件互连对成本的重要影响。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Conclusion: PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推问题，提升了离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中路由不可微分、不灵活以及稀疏性不足的问题，使其更适合低资源条件下的加速。

Method: 采用ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器设计，引入CLS感知的训练目标，并实现高效的加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在稀疏性和加速性能上优于其他MoE基线，TLS超过80%，8-token CLS达到70%，在终端设备上实现3.67倍加速。

Conclusion: BlockFFN通过改进路由和稀疏性设计，显著提升了MoE架构的性能和加速效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ORAC的探索性方法，用于风险规避约束强化学习（RaCRL），旨在通过乐观探索避免保守策略的次优收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风险规避通常导致环境探索过于保守，从而收敛到次优策略，无法最大化奖励或实现目标。

Method: ORAC方法通过最大化奖励值函数的局部上界置信区间，同时最小化风险规避成本值函数的局部下界置信区间，动态调整成本权重以鼓励探索。

Result: 实验表明，ORAC避免了次优策略的收敛，并在多个连续控制任务中显著改善了奖励与成本的权衡。

Conclusion: ORAC方法在满足安全约束的同时，有效提升了策略的性能和探索能力。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Conclusion: GreedyLore填补了贪婪低秩压缩的收敛理论空白，兼具高效性和理论保证。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Motivation: 揭示因果抽象在无限制对齐映射下的局限性，挑战线性表示假设的普遍适用性。

Result: 无限制对齐映射使因果抽象变得无意义，提出非线性表示困境。

Conclusion: 因果抽象不足以实现机制可解释性，需结合信息编码假设进行研究。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.
