This work rejects that premise. It\nproposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric\nconsequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in\nbiological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival\nManifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature\ngeodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A\nsurvival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is\nintroduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric\nflow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective\nand prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of\nsurvival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The\nframework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci\ncurvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.\nHealth, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions\nin the manifold's structure.

However,\ntraditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes,\noften overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for\nlearning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing\nrole-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal\nperformance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively\nintegrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN\nutilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships\nand combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable\nmamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction\nmethods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the\nconnections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's\nrepresentational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution\nlayers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph\nstructures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we\nincorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature\npropagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly\nintroduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nHGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node\nclassification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods.

This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.\n  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model\nto predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair\nvalue of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies\nby simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel\nusing GPU acceleration.\n  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms\nwhere the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as\nturn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCUDA\u52a0\u901f\u7684Pasur\u7eb8\u724c\u6e38\u620f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548cCFR\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd1\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Pasur\u6e38\u620f\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u6811\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528PyTorch CUDA\u5f20\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6e38\u620f\u6811\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7ee7\u627f\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u8f6e\u53cd\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc710^9\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6e38\u620f\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u73a9\u4f30\u8ba1\u724c\u7ec4\u516c\u5e73\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To understand why\ngraph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by\nredundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing\noptimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose\nRGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity\nas explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote\ntoken diversity.

In this work, we introduce a new\nperspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into\nconstructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two\ndistributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be\nmutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.\nThen, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial\nphase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local\ndenoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an\ninformation-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on\nconditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a\nreal-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures\nof diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small\nlocal neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are\nonly necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions.

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results\nfor genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation\ndefined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides).

Its objective is not to maximize task\nreward, but to build a world model and distill its understanding into concise\nmessages. The emergent communication protocol is shaped by a novel Causal\nInfluence Loss, which measures the effect that the message has on the next\naction. During deployment, the previously trained IA serves as a fixed\ncontextualizer for a new Control Agent (CA), which learns to solve tasks by\ninterpreting the provided communicative context. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat this approach enables the CA to achieve significant gains in sample\nefficiency and successfully perform zero-shot adaptation with the help of\npre-trained IA in entirely unseen sparse-reward environments, validating the\nefficacy of learning a transferable communicative representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCORAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u672a\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "CORAL\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u53cc\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee3\u7406\uff08IA\uff09\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7406\uff08CA\uff09\u3002IA\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u6d88\u606f\uff0cCA\u5229\u7528\u6d88\u606f\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCORAL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Effective\nand efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and\nunderstanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these\narchives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional\ncomplexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework\nto automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American\nIncarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,\nevaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in\nhistorically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By\nbridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the\ngroundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities\nand preservation of collective memory.

Parsons", "Prakash Chandra Shukla"], "title": "Beyond Problem Solving: Framing and Problem-Solution Co-Evolution in Data Visualization Design", "comment": "Author version; article accepted to IEEE VIS 2025; will be published\n  in IEEE TVCG in 2026", "summary": "Visualization design is often described as the process of solving a\nwell-defined problem by navigating a design space. While existing visualization\ndesign models have provided valuable structure and guidance, they tend to\nforeground technical problem-solving and underemphasize the interpretive,\njudgment-based aspects of design. In contrast, research in other design\ndisciplines has emphasized the importance of framing--how designers define and\nredefine what the problem is--and the co-evolution of problem and solution\nspaces through reflective practice. These dimensions remain underexplored in\nvisualization research, particularly from the perspective of expert\npractitioners. This paper investigates how visualization designers frame\nproblems and navigate the dynamic interplay between problem understanding and\nsolution development. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 11 expert\npractitioners using design challenges, diary entries, and semi-structured\ninterviews. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified key strategies\nthat participants used to frame problems, reframe them in response to evolving\nconstraints or insights, and build bridges between problem and solution spaces.\nThese included using metaphors, heuristics, sketching, primary generators, and\nreflective evaluation of failed or incomplete ideas. Our findings contribute an\nempirically grounded account of visualization design as a reflective,\nco-evolutionary practice, where framing is not a preliminary step but a\ncontinuous activity embedded in design.

Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to\nenvironmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also\nstrongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often\noverlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by\nincorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise\nrelationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In\npractice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information\nabout the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across\nlocations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based\nmethod for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species\nObservations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number\nof species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the\nvariability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our\napproach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen\nfor plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for\nbutterflies. Our results show that including partial biotic information\nimproves predictive performance on spatially separate test sets. When\nconditioned on a subset of species within the same dataset, CISO outperforms\nalternative methods in predicting the distribution of the remaining species.\nFurthermore, we show that combining observations from multiple datasets can\nimprove performance.

To address this, we\npropose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The\nmethod combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise\nmerging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments\nare conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a\nunified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this\ncorpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The\nresults show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER\nperformance in the low-resource financial domain.

While automated formalization\noffers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination\n(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and\nthe semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language\ndescriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven\nRetrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances\nLLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core\nmathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.\nHowever, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is\nnon-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic\nnature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal\nretrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a\nconcept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical\nlibrary for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions\nand 1,000+ core mathematical concepts.

While the\nheterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of\ncomplex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this\nstudy, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to\nexplain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield\nprediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,\nregions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral\nsatellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.\nBased on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using\ntwo methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and\nevaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,\nShapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality\nActivation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS\nattributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform\nother architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,\nachieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field\nlevels, respectively.

Our\nmethod is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to\nexhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display\ngreater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two\ncomplementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment\ndistribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering\nand semantic-preserving transformations.

Without introducing additional classifier training\noverhead, CFDG leverages classifier-free guidance diffusion to significantly\nenhance the generation quality of offline and online data with different\ndistributions. Additionally, it employs a reweighting method to enable more\ngenerated data to align with the online data, enhancing performance while\nmaintaining the agent's stability. Experimental results show that CFDG\noutperforms replaying the two data types or using a standard diffusion model to\ngenerate new data. Our method is versatile and can be integrated with existing\noffline-to-online RL algorithms. By implementing CFDG to popular methods IQL,\nPEX and APL, we achieve a notable 15% average improvement in empirical\nperformance on the D4RL benchmark such as MuJoCo and AntMaze.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5CFDG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\uff08CFDG\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCFDG\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CFDG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although such events are\nincreasingly conducted, research on them remains fragmented, with limited\nintegration between hackathon studies and hybrid collaboration. Existing\nstrategies for in-person or online-only events often fail to address the unique\nchallenges of hybrid formats, such as managing communication across physical\nand virtual spaces. Our work addresses this gap by examining how hybrid\nhackathons function, analyzing how organizers structure these events and how\nparticipants navigate hybrid-specific challenges. Drawing on established\ntheories of hybrid collaboration, we examine key dimensions - synchronicity,\nphysical distribution, dynamic transitions, and technological infrastructure -\nthat shape collaboration in hybrid events. Through an exploratory case study of\nthree hackathon events, we analyze how these dimensions are implemented and\ntheir effects on participant experiences. Our findings reveal differing\norganizer considerations of the hybrid dimensions in the hackathon design,\nleading to distinct experiences for participants. Implementation styles -\nfavoring in-person, online, or balanced participation - led to varied\nparticipant experiences, affecting access to resources, communication, and team\ncoordination. Organizers in our study also relied on technology to bridge\nhybrid interactions, but overlooked critical aspects like time-zone management,\ndynamic transitions, and targeted support for hybrid teams. Additionally,\nparticipants in their teams responded to gaps in event scaffolding by adapting\ncollaboration strategies, revealing gaps in organizers' preparedness for hybrid\nevents.

This has led to the development of new\ntechniques for street and pedestrian network visualization, expanding how data\ncan be shown and understood more effectively. Despite their increasing\nadoption, there is no established design framework to guide the creation of\nthese visualizations while addressing the diverse requirements of various\ndomains. When exploring a feature of interest, domain experts often need to\ntransform, integrate, and visualize a combination of thematic data (e.g.,\ndemographic, socioeconomic, pollution) and physical data (e.g., zip codes,\nstreet networks), often spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. This not\nonly complicates the process of visual data exploration and system\nimplementation for developers but also creates significant entry barriers for\nexperts who lack a background in programming. With this in mind, in this paper,\nwe reviewed 45 studies utilizing street-overlaid visualizations to understand\nhow they are used. Through qualitative coding of these visualizations, we\nanalyzed three key aspects of street and pedestrian network visualization\nusage: the analytical purpose they serve, the visualization approaches\nemployed, and the data sources used in their creation. Building on this design\nspace, we introduce StreetWeave, a declarative grammar for designing custom\nvisualizations of multivariate spatial network data across multiple\nresolutions.

We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by\naugmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10\nattributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary\ngender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.\nFocusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias\nthrough the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called\nCoreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less\nconfident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five\nrecently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along\nvarious demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and\nsocio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about\ndoubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings.

These factors create asymmetric\npower relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.\nThe paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism\nin ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce\nproblematic language ideologies.

Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM\nbased and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and\n87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and\ninference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQuiZSF\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSPMs\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff08ZSF\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6216\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86QuiZSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7684ChronoRAG Base\uff08CRB\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff08MSIL\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5668\uff08MCC\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0eTSPMs\u3002", "result": "QuiZSF\u572875%\uff08\u975eLLM\u57fa\u7840\uff09\u548c87.5%\uff08LLM\u57fa\u7840\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "QuiZSF\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u548cTSPMs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce \\textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel\nsingle-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,\npath-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is\na \\textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL\nbalance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize\nlong-term task performance.

It approximates the update of a\npretrained weight matrix $W\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ by the product of two\nlow-rank matrices, $BA$, where $A \\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times n}$ and\n$B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r} (r\\ll\\min\\{m,n\\})$. Increasing the dimension $r$\ncan raise the rank of LoRA weights (i.e., $BA$), which typically improves\nfine-tuning performance but also significantly increases the number of\ntrainable parameters. In this paper, we propose Block Diversified Low-Rank\nAdaptation (BoRA), which improves the rank of LoRA weights with a small number\nof additional parameters. Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block\nmatrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along\nthe columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\\dots,A_b]$ and\n$B=[B_1,\\dots,B_b]^\\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the\nconcatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\\in[b]$.

This \"semantic drift\" compromises data\nreproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,\na novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained\nschema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method\nidentifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation\nlogic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of\ndata transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this\npaper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that\nassesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is\nalso presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world\nindustrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from\n1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like\nGPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema\nlineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting\ntechniques.

In this\nwork, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting\nby modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.\nSpecifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions\nmultivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling\nlocalized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the\nmodality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal\nfeatures with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of\ntime series into language-based models while eliminating the need for\nhandcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world\nbenchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all\ndatasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\\% over recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to\ngenerate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To\naccomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of\nreports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics\nfrom each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a\npublished strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that\nthese techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the\nelements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs\nbest in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving\na \"medium\" or \"strong\" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan\ndevelopment impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal\ngovernment in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the\npublic good.

However, most existing\nagent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after\ndeployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving\nenvironments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution\ntechniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction\ndata and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation\nfor self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation\nmodels with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for\nself-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified\nconceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of\nself-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:\nSystem Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a\nfoundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this\nframework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques\nthat target different components of the agent system. We also investigate\ndomain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as\nbiomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are\ntightly coupled with domain constraints.

However, modeling this progression\nremains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained\nthrough irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of\npathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where\ntraditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms\ndominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert\nweighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to\nproperly estimate the temporal position of individual observations,\nconstructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots.\nModel-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural\ndiffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and\ntime, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also\nintroduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond\nstandard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these\ncomponents across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how\nstage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression.

Formal query languages such as SPARQL offer\nexpressive access but require users to understand the ontology's structure and\nsyntax. In contrast, visual exploration tools and basic keyword-based search\ninterfaces are easier to use but often lack flexibility and expressiveness. We\nintroduce FuzzyVis, a proof-of-concept system that enables intuitive and\nexpressive exploration of complex ontologies. FuzzyVis integrates two key\ncomponents: a fuzzy logic-based querying model built on fuzzy ontology\nembeddings, and an interactive visual interface for building and interpreting\nqueries. Users can construct new composite concepts by selecting and combining\nexisting ontology concepts using logical operators such as conjunction,\ndisjunction, and negation. These composite concepts are matched against the\nontology using fuzzy membership-based embeddings, which capture degrees of\nmembership and support approximate, concept-level similarity search.

The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by\nthe domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and\ncomplex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be\nmitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as\nexemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and\ncost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for\nautomated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to\nstandard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional\nQ network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a\nlower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action\nselection and estimation bias of Q values.

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from\nclassroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the\nstudent try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the\nmind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows\na 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on\nMATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements\nover the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model\nthat evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained\npreferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.\nFinally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nachieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,\nsignificantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the\nstate-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLoc\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u8ba2\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6811\u89c4\u6a21\u5feb\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u9ad8\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "ReLoc\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u8d77\u8349\u3001\u90bb\u57df\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5019\u9009\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fee\u8ba2\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReLoc\u5728\u591a\u6837\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6784\u9020\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLoc\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the\nLost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information\nappears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,\nrather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently\nreplicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the\nconditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,\ndefined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that\nthe LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context\nwindow. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains\nrelatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we\nobserve a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant\ninformation is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest\nthat successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the\nobserved positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.\nThese insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future\nLLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5982\u201c\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u201d\uff08LiM\uff09\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5360\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e350%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65f6\u6700\u5f3a\u3002\u8d85\u8fc7\u540e\uff0c\u9996\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982LiM\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "LiM\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5360\u7a97\u53e350%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65f6\u6700\u5f3a\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u540e\uff0c\u9996\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u3001LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

While\nprior methods rely on offline trajectory comparisons to elicit human\npreferences, such data is unavailable in online learning scenarios where agents\nmust adapt on the fly. Recent approaches address this by collecting real-time\nscalar feedback to guide agent behavior and train reward models for continued\nlearning after human feedback becomes unavailable. However, scalar feedback is\noften noisy and inconsistent, limiting the accuracy and generalization of\nlearned rewards. We propose Pref-GUIDE, a framework that transforms real-time\nscalar feedback into preference-based data to improve reward model learning for\ncontinual policy training. Pref-GUIDE Individual mitigates temporal\ninconsistency by comparing agent behaviors within short windows and filtering\nambiguous feedback.

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine\nTranslation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without\nrelying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for\nLLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based\nQE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than\nregression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource\nlanguages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task.

A standard goal\nin RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an\nadversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the\nprobabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,\nsuch optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value\niteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,\nwhich, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different\nexpected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.\nHence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing\ninspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.\nInstead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,\nwe additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under\ndifferent (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training.

Most existing research focuses on\ncombining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world\nscenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or\norganizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different\ndata sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to\nheterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield\nunsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a\ncriterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the\nopen-world setting.

This study is the first to reveal that\nstrategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring\nmathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of\nstylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we\nformalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,\nReciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical\nresponses.

We\nextend the Nesy theory based on reliable knowledge to the scenario of\nunreliable knowledge (i.e., assumptions), thereby unifying the theoretical\nframeworks of SSL and Nesy. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that, in theory, the impact of pretext tasks on target performance\nhinges on three factors: knowledge learnability with respect to the model,\nknowledge reliability with respect to the data, and knowledge completeness with\nrespect to the target.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having\nexpert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as\ndirect alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both\nindividual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized\ndomains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ndiscussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are\ntasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and\njustifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate\nreasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our\nempirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time\ntechniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal\nor even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting\ntheir broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate\nstatistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most\nsettings.

The Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse\nactivation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The\npresence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe\ndegradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,\nsignificantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,\nefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to\nbalance latency and throughput.

As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a\nhigh-dimensional variable $\\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a\nlower-dimensional variable $z = \\phi(\\theta)$, for an architecture-related\nfunction $\\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how\nit is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the\nfactorization $\\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion\nof kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property\nto hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth\nand show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an\nintrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the\ninitialization, when $\\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of\nlinear networks with $\\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced\ninitializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we\ngeneralize this result to a broader class of {\\em relaxed balanced}\ninitializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the\n\\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.\nFinally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep\nlinear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express\nthe corresponding intrinsic dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5305\u542b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u88ab\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53d8\u91cf\u03b8\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53d8\u91cfz=\u03d5(\u03b8)\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u653e\u5bbd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u4fdd\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Accepted at ICML 2025 Workshop on Methods and Opportunities\n  at Small Scale", "summary": "Recent work has shown that LRNN models such as S4D, Mamba, and DeltaNet lack\nstate-tracking capability due to either time-invariant transition matrices or\nrestricted eigenvalue ranges. To address this, input-dependent transition\nmatrices, particularly those that are complex or non-triangular, have been\nproposed to enhance SSM performance on such tasks. While existing theorems\ndemonstrate that both input-independent and non-negative SSMs are incapable of\nsolving simple state-tracking tasks, such as parity, regardless of depth, they\ndo not explore whether combining these two types in a multilayer SSM could\nhelp.

Early and accurate\nprediction of lightning would enable preventive measures to safeguard people,\nprotect property, and minimize economic losses. In this paper, we present\nDeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning\noccurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they\noften struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty\nof lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar\nreflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather\nPrediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly\nsensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight\nleverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud\nproperties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder\narchitecture.

This study proposes a physics-informed multimodal convolutional\nneural network (CNN) with a late fusion architecture, integrating vibration and\nmotor current signals alongside a dedicated physics-based feature extraction\nbranch. The model incorporates a novel physics-informed loss function that\npenalizes physically implausible predictions based on characteristic bearing\nfault frequencies - Ball Pass Frequency Outer (BPFO) and Ball Pass Frequency\nInner (BPFI) - derived from bearing geometry and shaft speed. Comprehensive\nexperiments on the Paderborn University dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nphysics-informed approach consistently outperforms a non-physics-informed\nbaseline, achieving higher accuracy, reduced false classifications, and\nimproved robustness across multiple data splits. To address performance\ndegradation under unseen operating conditions, three transfer learning (TL)\nstrategies - Target-Specific Fine-Tuning (TSFT), Layer-Wise Adaptation Strategy\n(LAS), and Hybrid Feature Reuse (HFR) - are evaluated. Results show that LAS\nyields the best generalization, with additional performance gains when combined\nwith physics-informed modeling.

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off.

However, despite recent progress, studies\nshow that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained\nlanguages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a\ntext-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in\nspeech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by\nexploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.\nTo mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization\n(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport\nproblem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or\nlearnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training\nprocedures.

We have a trained score network for a prior $p(x)$, a\nmeasurement model $p(y|x)$, and are tasked with sampling from the posterior\n$p(x|y)$. Prior work has shown this to be intractable in KL (in the worst case)\nunder well-accepted computational hardness assumptions. Despite this, popular\nalgorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and\nreconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional\nassumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is\ntractable, we view this as a more general \"tilting\" problem of biasing a\ndistribution towards a measurement.

In recent years, numerous attribution methods\nhave been developed to explain DNNs. However, a persistent concern remains\nunresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the\nactual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention. We\nsummarize these developments, with emphasis on three key directions: (i)\nTheoretical unification, which uncovers commonalities and differences among\nmethods, enabling systematic comparisons; (ii) Theoretical rationale,\nclarifying the foundations of existing methods; (iii) Theoretical evaluation,\nrigorously proving whether methods satisfy faithfulness principles.

In\nthis paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first\nderive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a\nkey Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference\nconflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it\nto formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle.

To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical\nmethods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our\nPD selection method.

This architecture\nenables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,\nanomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single\nend-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms\nexisting methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.\nFurthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation\nsummaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent\nand efficient maritime traffic management.", "AI": {"tldr": "AIS-LLM\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217AIS\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d77\u4e8b\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8003\u8651\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "AIS-LLM\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAIS-LLM\u5728\u5404\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u60c5\u5883\u7b80\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "AIS-LLM\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d77\u4e8b\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be\nretrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one\npossible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the\nsemantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.\nSemantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic\nsimilarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:\none must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached\nresponses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities\nand serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time.

In this work, we propose a socially-aware privacy-preserving FL\nmechanism that systematically quantifies indirect privacy leakage through a\nmulti-hop propagation model.

To mitigate information asymmetry in networked\nprivacy estimation, we introduce a mean-field estimator to approximate the\naverage external privacy risk. We theoretically prove the existence and\nconvergence of the fixed point of the mean-field estimator and derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium.

Recent studies have leveraged the\ngeneralization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time\nseries forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies\nfocus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic\nmodality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data\npatterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent\nperiodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the\nsemantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the\ninterpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs\nfor temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel\nat capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term\nanomalies in time-series data.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions.

However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,\noptimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that\nfails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages.

This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a\nNobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures\nfrom amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular\ninteractions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,\na reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like\nbehavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative\nadvance.

We propose SHARK (Shapley Reweighted $k$-means), a\nfeature-weighted clustering algorithm motivated by the use of Shapley values\nfrom cooperative game theory to quantify feature relevance, which requires no\nadditional parameters beyond those in $k$-means. We prove that the $k$-means\nobjective can be decomposed into a sum of per-feature Shapley values, providing\nan axiomatic foundation for unsupervised feature relevance and reducing Shapley\ncomputation from exponential to polynomial time. SHARK iteratively re-weights\nfeatures by the inverse of their Shapley contribution, emphasising informative\ndimensions and down-weighting irrelevant ones. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world data sets show that SHARK consistently matches or outperforms\nexisting methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy, particularly in\nscenarios where noise may be present.

Model-driven TSE relies\non macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics.

Model-data dual-driven traffic state\nestimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more\naccurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time.

Simulating students' memory states is a\npromising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of\nknowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:\nencoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests\nduring the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,\nundifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as\nwell as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes\nmemoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational\nautoencoder.

However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which\nthey acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from\na theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures.
