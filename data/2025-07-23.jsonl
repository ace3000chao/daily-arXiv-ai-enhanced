Because XAI systems provide human-understandable\nexplanations for their output, they are often viewed as a primary path to\nprevent harms to patients. However, when harm occurs, laws, policies, and\nregulations also shape AI accountability by impacting how harmed individuals\ncan obtain recourse. Current approaches to XAI explore physicians' medical and\nrelational needs to counter harms to patients, but there is a need to\nunderstand how XAI systems should account for the legal considerations of those\nimpacted. We conduct an analysis of 31 legal cases and reported harms to\nidentify patterns around how AI systems impact patient care. Our findings\nreflect how patients' medical care relies on a complex web of\nstakeholders--physicians, state health departments, health insurers, care\nfacilities, among others--and many AI systems deployed across their healthcare\ndelivery negatively impact their care. In response, patients have had no option\nbut to seek legal recourse for harms. We shift the frame from\nphysician-centered to patient-centered accountability approaches by describing\nhow lawyers and technologists need to recognize and address where AI harms\nhappen. We present paths for preventing or countering harm (1) by changing\nliability structures to reflect the role of many stakeholders in shaping how AI\nsystems impact patient care; and (2) by designing XAI systems that can help\nadvocates, such as legal representatives, who provide critical legal expertise\nand practically support recourse for patients."}

Williams"], "title": "The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture", "comment": null, "summary": "Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural\ncoherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale."}

TTD-DR initiates this process with a\npreliminary draft, an updatable skeleton that serves as an evolving foundation\nto guide the research direction. The draft is then iteratively refined through\na \"denoising\" process, which is dynamically informed by a retrieval mechanism\nthat incorporates external information at each step. The core process is\nfurther enhanced by a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of\nthe agentic workflow, ensuring the generation of high-quality context for the\ndiffusion process. This draft-centric design makes the report writing process\nmore timely and coherent while reducing information loss during the iterative\nsearch process. We demonstrate that our TTD-DR achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on a wide array of benchmarks that require intensive search and\nmulti-hop reasoning, significantly outperforming existing deep research agents."}

None of these\nextensions have studied clauses with negation allowed in the body. We\ninvestigate an extension of CLP which unifies many of these extensions and\nallows negation in the body. We provide semantics for such programs, using the\nframework of approximation fixpoint theory, and give a detailed overview of the\nimpacts of properties of the semirings on the resulting semantics.

We review historical precedents, from\ninverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing\nclassifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased\ndifficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define\nthe judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a\nprompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,\nand cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's\nfeasible strategy set M.

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely\ncollected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the\nearly detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over\ntime.

To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals\nfrom the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large\nlanguage model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological\nfeatures from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT\nnumerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately\nempowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic\nreport.

As\nthese agents become increasingly capable, market readiness is rapidly\napproaching, which means those agents, for example taking the form of humanoid\nrobots or autonomous cars, are poised to transition from laboratory prototypes\nto autonomous operation in real-world environments. This transition raises\nconcerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the\nrequirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research\ndirected toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave\nethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a\nrange of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.\nThis study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents\n(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning\narchitecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative\nreasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn\na reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant\npropositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback.

However, the explosive\ngrowth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials,\nprocesses, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for\nresearchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in\nthis rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a\nspecialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities\ntailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By\nsystematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications\nand integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we\nconstructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated\nquestion-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning.

We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such\nself-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction\nmainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather\nthan misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of\nleveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model\nunderstanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the\ngeneration-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and\nunderstanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known\nin pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows\nimprovements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously\nincorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned\ntraining dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced\nprompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the\nunderstanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of\nco-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is\nempirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics\nlike Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,\nwhich highlights the necessity of data quality check.

The current\nsolutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are\ndense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This\npaper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform\nparameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based\nrecommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt\nembeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by\ntreating each of the users as the tasks.

The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic\nsampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On\nMovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model\noutperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in\nreal-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization\nis also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation\nallows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening\ndetection latency and improving payment network stability. Crucially, the 275\nms adaptation capability can enable real-time risk profiling for financial\ninstitutions, reducing systemic vulnerability detection latency significantly\nversus traditional compliance checks.

Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck\nchallenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a\nsingle prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we\npropose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO\noptimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit\nLLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by\nmaximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,\ntheoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,\nresulting in effective value instructions.

Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores.
