### [1] [Bridging AI Innovation and Healthcare Needs: Lessons Learned from Incorporating Modern NLP at The BC Cancer Registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09991)
*Lovedeep Gondara,Gregory Arbour,Raymond Ng,Jonathan Simkin,Shebnum Devji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文总结了在临床文档中自动化数据提取的经验教训，强调了明确业务目标、迭代开发、跨学科合作及实用模型选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过自然语言处理（NLP）技术提高医疗数据管理效率，但实际部署面临挑战。

Method: 采用迭代开发方法，结合跨学科合作，选择实用模型（包括混合方法），并注重数据质量和错误缓解策略。

Result: 提供了可推广的实践指南，帮助医疗机构成功实施AI/NLP解决方案。

Conclusion: 明确业务目标、跨学科合作和实用方法是成功部署NLP技术的关键。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

### [2] [A Transparent Fairness Evaluation Protocol for Open-Source Language Model Benchmarking on the Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09993)
*Hugo Massaroli,Leonardo Iara,Emmanuel Iarussi,Viviana Siless*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于区块链的透明评估协议，用于衡量开源大语言模型（LLMs）的公平性，并在多个数据集和语言中进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在高风险领域（如刑事司法、教育、医疗和金融）的应用日益广泛，公平性问题备受关注，需要一种可验证、不可篡改且可复现的评估方法。

Method: 通过智能合约在ICP区块链上执行评估，使用Hugging Face端点的链上HTTP请求，并将数据集、提示和指标存储在链上。评估了Llama、DeepSeek和Mistral模型在PISA数据集上的表现，并扩展到多语言评估。

Result: 结果显示模型在公平性和社会偏见方面存在差异，并通过多语言评估揭示了跨语言的不一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为社区提供了开源工具和结果，支持对模型版本的长期公平性跟踪和审计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

### [3] [Thematic and Task-Based Categorization of K-12 GenAI Usages with Hierarchical Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09997)
*Johannes Schneider,Béatrice S. Hasler,Michaela Varrone,Fabian Hoya,Thomas Schroffenegger,Dana-Kristin Mah,Karl Peböck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过新颖的主题建模方法分析了未成年人在课堂中的匿名互动数据，对17,000多条消息进行了内容和任务维度的分类，发现了新的应用，并改进了传统文本分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对内容和主题的分类，且任务分类在K-12教育中缺乏真实数据支持。

Method: 采用分层分类方法，结合先进的大语言模型（LLMs）进行主题建模，改进传统方法的不足。

Result: 发现了新的应用场景，并展示了LLMs在主题建模中的优越性。

Conclusion: 研究为生成式AI在教育中的应用提供了支持，同时提出了未来研究的开放问题和关注点。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

### [4] [INTIMA: A Benchmark for Human-AI Companionship Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09998)
*Lucie-Aimée Kaffee,Giada Pistilli,Yacine Jernite*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: INTIMA是一个评估语言模型陪伴行为的基准，基于心理学理论和用户数据开发了31种行为的分类，并应用于多个模型，发现陪伴强化行为更常见，但不同模型在敏感部分表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI陪伴行为对用户情感的影响，开发一个标准化的评估工具（INTIMA）以量化语言模型的陪伴行为。

Method: 基于心理学理论和用户数据，开发了31种行为的分类和368个针对性提示，评估模型回应为陪伴强化、边界维持或中性。

Result: Gemma-3、Phi-4、o3-mini和Claude-4模型中陪伴强化行为更常见，但不同模型在敏感部分表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 需要更一致的方法处理情感互动，以确保用户福祉。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

### [5] [XFacta: Contemporary, Real-World Dataset and Evaluation for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09999)
*Yuzhuo Xiao,Zeyu Han,Yuhan Wang,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了XFacta数据集，用于评估基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的虚假信息检测方法，并分析了现有方法的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态虚假信息检测中现有方法的瓶颈和数据集过时或合成的问题。

Method: 引入XFacta数据集，系统评估不同MLLM架构和规模的检测策略，并提出半自动更新框架。

Result: XFacta数据集和半自动框架为多模态虚假信息检测提供了新见解和实践。

Conclusion: 论文为多模态虚假信息检测领域提供了有价值的进展和公开资源。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

### [6] [AutoGeTS: Knowledge-based Automated Generation of Text Synthetics for Improving Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10000)
*Chenhao Xue,Yuanzhe Jin,Adrian Carrasco-Revilla,Joyraj Chakraborty,Min Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型（LLM）生成合成数据，并通过自动化工作流程优化输入示例，以提高文本分类模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中文本分类模型因数据不足而难以训练的问题。

Method: 通过LLM生成合成数据，并采用三种搜索策略优化输入示例，最终提出一种集成算法。

Result: 实验表明，集成方法比单一策略更有效，能显著提升分类模型性能。

Conclusion: 利用LLM生成合成数据并结合自动化工作流程，是解决数据不足问题的有效方法。

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [7] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对低资源混合语言（如Hinglish）的事实核查新基准HiFACT数据集，并开发了一种图感知的检索增强模型，显著优于现有多语言基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统主要针对高资源单语言环境，无法适应印度等多语言地区的政治话语，而Hinglish的广泛使用和社会媒体的影响使得开发多语言、上下文感知的工具变得迫切。

Method: 引入HiFACT数据集（1500条Hinglish政治声明），并提出一种结合多语言上下文编码、语义对齐、证据图构建、图神经网络推理和自然语言解释生成的模型。

Result: HiFACTMix模型在准确性和解释性上优于现有多语言基线。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言、混合语言和政治相关的事实核查开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [8] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的词嵌入矩阵中的语义关联与人类评分的低维结构相似，且语义特征在LLMs中纠缠方式与人类语言类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs中语义特征的结构是否与人类语言相似，以及如何避免在调整语义特征时产生意外影响。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的词嵌入矩阵，比较其与人类评分的语义方向（如反义词对）的相关性，并研究语义特征的维度。

Result: LLMs的语义特征可简化为3维子空间，与人类评分的模式高度一致；调整一个语义方向会影响几何对齐的其他特征。

Conclusion: LLMs的语义结构低维且与人类语言相似，理解这一结构对避免调整语义时的副作用至关重要。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

### [9] [User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10004)
*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了注意力权重在生物医学文献分类中作为解释工具的实用性，发现其效果受可视化方式影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索注意力权重是否能为医生提供有用的解释，以及可视化方式如何影响其效果。

Method: 通过用户研究，让医学专家分类文献，评估不同注意力可视化方式的效果。

Result: XLNet模型分类准确，但注意力权重解释性有限，可视化方式显著影响用户感知。

Conclusion: 注意力权重的解释效果受可视化方式影响，需进一步优化呈现形式。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

### [10] [From Answers to Questions: EQGBench for Evaluating LLMs' Educational Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10005)
*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQGBench是一个针对中文教育问题生成（EQG）的基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成高质量教育问题方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学解题方面表现出色，但在生成具有教育价值的问题方面仍存在挑战，需要进一步探索。

Method: 通过EQGBench，建立了一个五维评估框架，包含900个评估样本，涵盖数学、物理和化学三个学科。

Result: 对46个主流大型模型的系统评估显示，它们在生成具有教育价值的问题方面仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: EQGBench为LLMs在教育问题生成领域的发展提供了重要参考，并揭示了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [11] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型自动评分AIHQ开放式问题的可行性，结果显示模型评分与人工评分一致，且能区分TBI与健康对照组。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AIHQ开放式问题评分耗时的问题，探索大型语言模型的自动化潜力。

Method: 使用AIHQ数据集，通过微调模型并测试其与人工评分的一致性。

Result: 模型评分与人工评分高度一致，能区分TBI与健康对照组，且适用于非临床数据集。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可有效自动化AIHQ评分，适用于研究和临床场景。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出使用贝叶斯融合方法结合预训练通用LLM和本地数据分类器的分类分数，避免昂贵的微调，性能优于单独分类器，且与微调方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程讨论论坛的自动管理需要频繁更新，导致LLM的频繁重新训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出贝叶斯融合方法，结合预训练通用LLM和本地数据分类器的多维分类分数。

Result: 融合方法性能优于单独分类器，且与微调方法竞争。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种有效且资源友好的替代微调的方法。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种监督混合专家模型（S-MoE），通过任务专用令牌分配任务到独立专家网络，解决了硬参数共享中的任务干扰问题，并在语音转文本任务中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬参数共享在多任务学习中常导致任务干扰，影响模型性能，需要一种更有效的方法来分配任务资源。

Method: S-MoE利用指导令牌直接将任务分配到独立的专家网络，无需训练门控函数，避免了任务干扰。

Result: 在语音转文本任务中，S-MoE实现了6.35%的词错误率相对改进。

Conclusion: S-MoE是一种简单有效的多任务学习方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

### [14] [An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10010)
*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成医疗错误信息方面的效果，以及如何利用LLMs检测和防止错误信息的传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能被用于生成有害的错误信息，但同时也可能成为检测和防止错误信息的工具。

Method: 分析了109种针对三种目标LLMs的攻击，并比较了生成的错误信息与Reddit上的医疗错误信息。

Result: LLMs可以有效检测来自其他LLMs和人类的错误信息。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计，LLMs可以促进更健康的信息生态系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）的生成式AI在营养学教育中的应用，尤其是日本注册营养师国家考试中的表现。结果显示部分模型勉强通过及格线，但整体准确性和答案一致性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI在营养学教育中的潜力，特别是在日本注册营养师国家考试中作为学习辅助工具的效果。

Method: 使用日本注册营养师考试题目作为提示，测试ChatGPT和三种Bing模型（Precise、Creative、Balanced）的准确性、一致性和响应时间，并进行提示工程优化。

Result: Bing-Precise（66.2%）和Bing-Creative（61.4%）超过及格线（60%），但其他模型表现不佳。所有模型在答案一致性上存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 当前生成式AI模型在营养学教育中的表现有限，需进一步改进以提高可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化文本生成评估常忽略用户个体差异，现有方法缺乏对用户特定对齐的衡量。

Method: PREF采用三步流程：1）LLM生成通用准则；2）基于用户偏好重排和增强准则；3）LLM根据个性化准则评分。

Result: 在PrefEval基准测试中，PREF比基线方法更准确、校准更好，更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: PREF为个性化语言生成系统的可靠评估和开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG Explore框架通过引入中间指导图，解决了LLMs在知识密集型任务中的局限性，实现了高效且精确的知识检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型任务中表现受限，因其依赖静态知识和不透明的推理过程。知识图谱（KGs）虽为解决方案，但现有方法存在粒度不匹配或上下文利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出GG Explore框架，引入中间指导图（Guidance Graph），结合结构化对齐和上下文感知剪枝技术，优化知识检索。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂任务中效率更高，性能优于现有技术，且在小规模LLMs上仍保持良好表现。

Conclusion: GG Explore通过指导图有效解决了知识检索中的效率与精度问题，展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

TL;DR: Semantic Bridge框架通过语义图编织技术，可控地生成复杂多跳推理问题，显著提升LLM训练数据的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量、推理密集型问答对稀缺的问题，尤其是稀疏领域特定来源（如PubMed论文或法律文件）。

Method: 采用语义图编织技术，包括实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接，结合AMR驱动分析，系统构建复杂推理路径。

Result: 在多语言和多领域评估中表现优异，生成的问题对在复杂性和可回答性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge为LLM训练数据合成提供了新范式，能够从稀疏来源可控生成目标推理问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

TL;DR: PersonaEval是一个新基准，用于测试LLM评估者是否能可靠识别人类角色，结果显示当前LLM准确率仅69%，远低于人类的90.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色扮演研究依赖未验证的LLM评估范式，可能无法反映人类对角色保真度的感知。

Method: 提出PersonaEval基准，使用人类撰写的对话测试LLM的角色识别能力，并进行人类对比实验。

Result: 最佳LLM准确率为69%，人类为90.8%，显示LLM评估者尚不足够可靠。

Conclusion: 可靠评估需要LLM具备更强的人类推理能力，而非仅任务特定调整。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Motivation: 现有任务导向对话数据集多为文本形式，缺乏真实语音信号，且现有语音数据集多为英语，缺少语音不流畅性和说话者多样性等关键特征。

Method: 构建了RealTalk-CN数据集，包含5.4k对话（60K话语，150小时），并提出了跨模态聊天任务。

Result: 实验验证了RealTalk-CN的有效性，为中文语音语言模型研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN填补了中文语音-文本双模态数据集的空白，为语音语言模型研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型直接集成时的模态对齐、效率等问题，避免额外训练需求。

Method: 基于中央控制器LLM、并行TTS架构和跨模态记忆集成系统，动态路由任务并优化交互。

Result: 性能提升7.8%，延迟降低10.3%，显著增强可解释性。

Conclusion: MLLM编排框架有效实现多模态交互，无需训练，性能优越。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

Motivation: 自然语言中存在许多语义相同但表达不同的句子，LLMs在处理这些句子时通常会生成不同的概率分布，这一问题需要更抽象的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一个LLM Markov范畴来表示LLM生成的语言概率分布，并利用范畴同伦技术捕捉这些范畴中的“弱等价性”。

Result: 通过范畴同伦技术，能够更准确地处理语言中的等价重述问题，为LLMs提供更一致的语义表示。

Conclusion: 论文展示了范畴同伦理论在LLMs中的应用潜力，为解决语言模型中的语义一致性问题提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

TL;DR: 提出DURIT框架，通过将自然语言问题映射到规范问题空间，分离理解与推理，显著提升小型语言模型（SLMs）的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLMs）在复杂多变的自然语言中难以提取核心问题并推理，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出DURIT框架，包含三步算法：强化学习映射问题、自蒸馏对齐推理轨迹、在问题空间中训练推理策略。

Result: DURIT显著提升了SLMs在数学和逻辑推理任务中的性能，并增强了推理的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分离理解与推理是提升SLMs推理能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在提升大语言模型推理能力时，忽视了推理路径的质量和隐私保护，尤其在医疗领域需要可解释性和合规性。

Method: FedCoT通过轻量级的思维链增强机制，本地模型生成多条推理路径，并由紧凑判别器动态选择最优路径，同时采用改进的LoRA模块聚合方法。

Result: 实验表明，FedCoT在医疗推理任务中显著提升了客户端推理性能，同时完全保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedCoT为联邦学习中的推理能力提升提供了一种高效、隐私安全的解决方案，特别适用于医疗等敏感领域。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 金融应用中需要从客户历史通信序列中学习嵌入，但直接使用LLM处理长序列计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出LATTE框架，利用对比学习将行为特征总结为短提示，通过LLM嵌入并作为监督信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在金融数据集上优于现有技术，同时适合延迟敏感环境。

Conclusion: LATTE是一种高效且实用的金融事件序列表示学习方法。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: 该研究为高风险问答应用中的可信大语言模型部署提供了统计框架。

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

Motivation: 现有TTC策略（如TTT和RAG）对不同查询效果不一，盲目应用会导致高计算成本。

Method: RTTC结合奖励模型动态选择策略，采用分布式架构和查询状态缓存以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明RTTC在多个LLM和基准测试中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RTTC验证了自适应TTC策略的必要性，为高性能语言模型适配提供了潜力。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在复杂任务上表现出色，但其高推理成本和延迟限制了实际应用。SABER旨在解决这一问题，提供灵活的推理模式。

Method: SABER通过分析训练样本的推理令牌使用情况，将其分配到预定义的预算层级，并在微调时结合系统提示和长度感知奖励。同时引入无推理样本以确保模型可靠性。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和逻辑推理任务上，SABER在严格预算下仍保持高准确性，推理长度减少65.4%，准确率提升3.6%。

Conclusion: SABER通过灵活的推理模式和预算控制，显著提升了LLM的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于隐状态融合的越狱攻击方法（LFJ），通过插值有害和良性查询对的隐藏状态来绕过大语言模型的安全对齐，攻击成功率达94.01%。同时提出对抗训练防御方法，降低攻击成功率80%以上。

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在语言任务中表现优异，但易受越狱攻击绕过安全对齐。研究旨在提出一种高效的攻击方法并探索防御策略。

Method: LFJ方法通过选择高相似性的查询对，在关键层和令牌上进行梯度引导插值，并进行优化以平衡攻击成功率和效率。

Result: 在Vicuna和LLaMA-2等模型上，LFJ的平均攻击成功率为94.01%，优于现有方法。对抗训练防御将攻击成功率降低80%以上。

Conclusion: LFJ是一种高效的越狱攻击方法，对抗训练可有效防御，同时不影响良性输入的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IAPO的统一框架，联合优化提示和推理规模，同时考虑推理预算和任务目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法未考虑推理策略，而用户偏好和推理预算对提示和推理配置的选择有重要影响。

Method: 引入IAPO框架，开发PSST算法进行固定预算训练，并分析有限预算下的错误概率保证。

Result: 在六项任务上评估PSST的有效性，证明推理意识在提示优化中的关键作用。

Conclusion: IAPO框架通过联合优化提示和推理规模，显著提升了黑盒大语言模型的对齐效果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

Motivation: 探索LLMs思考模式在安全攻击中的脆弱性，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过添加特定思考标记来显式引导LLMs的内部思考过程。

Result: 安全思考干预显著降低了思考模式下LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 安全思考干预是提升LLMs思考模式安全性的有效方法。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Motivation: 传统方法忽视了模型在格式生成和语义提取上的混淆，导致信息提取效果不佳。

Method: 提出APIE框架，通过格式不确定性和内容不确定性量化模型混淆，并主动选择最具挑战性的样本作为示例。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，APIE显著优于基线方法，提高了提取准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 细粒度的双重不确定性视角对构建高效可靠的结构化生成系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Method: 引入了一套多轮任务基准测试，每个任务设计用于测试特定推理、对话和信息寻求能力，并采用确定性评分机制。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在多轮交互中存在显著不足，主要错误源于指令遵循、推理和规划能力差。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来改进大语言模型在复杂交互场景中的能力提供了重要平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域特定任务中，LLM作为评估者（LaaJ）面临数据稀缺和专家评估成本高的问题，现有指标未经验证，难以确定其有效性和阈值。

Method: LaaJMeter通过生成合成数据和虚拟模型，系统分析评估指标在真实条件下的表现，帮助测试指标区分能力并估算适当阈值。

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境下的LaaJ评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于提升NLP评估的可信度和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

Conclusion: 翻译难度估计器可用于构建更具挑战性的机器翻译基准，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

Conclusion: For-Value为大规模模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的数据评估方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

Method: 引入PakBBQ数据集，包含214个模板和17180个QA对，覆盖8个偏见维度，评估多语言LLMs在不同语境下的表现。

Result: 实验显示：消歧后准确率提升12%，乌尔都语的反偏见行为强于英语，负面提问减少刻板回答。

Conclusion: 强调情境化基准和简单提示工程策略在低资源环境中缓解偏见的重要性。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

Conclusion: SDM框架能有效检测LLM的Faithfulness Hallucinations，为生成文本的可靠性提供诊断工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

Motivation: BPRS评分虽有效但临床实践中因耗时较长而使用受限，需更高效、标准化的评估方法。

Method: 使用LLM从非结构化访谈转录中预测BPRS评分，并验证其在跨语言和纵向数据中的表现。

Result: LLM预测的BPRS评分与真实评估一致性高（中位数一致性0.84，ICC 0.73），跨语言表现更优（中位数一致性0.88，ICC 0.70）。

Conclusion: LLM可高效、标准化评估精神分裂症高危患者，潜力显著。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种定性框架，用于检测大型语言模型（LLM）中的性别和种族偏见，补充了现有的定量方法。通过分析LLM生成的短篇故事，发现黑人女性被刻画为与祖先和抵抗相关，而白人女性则表现为自我发现。研究揭示了模型在修正偏见时的局限性，并强调了跨学科方法对AI伦理设计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI的发展，大型语言模型（LLM）的应用日益广泛，但其可能复制和强化社会偏见的问题亟待解决。现有偏见检测方法多为定量分析，忽略了语言中偏见的细微表现。

Method: 研究采用定性、话语分析框架，手动分析LLM生成的关于黑人和白人女性的短篇故事，探讨性别和种族偏见的体现。

Result: 研究发现黑人女性被描述为与祖先和抵抗相关，白人女性则表现为自我发现。模型在修正偏见时仅提供表面修改，未能真正消除问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法的意识形态功能，强调了跨学科方法对AI伦理设计和部署的重要性，以解决LLM生成内容反映和加剧不平等的问题。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化评审方法在事实准确性、评分一致性和分析深度方面的不足，生成更高质量的评审反馈。

Method: 结合ArXiv-MCP检索增强的上下文生成管道、监督微调和强化学习，通过复合奖励函数提升评审质量和评分准确性。

Result: 在ICLR 2025论文上的实验表明，ReviewRL在规则和模型质量评估中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

TL;DR: DOTABLER是一个专注于表格语义解析的框架，旨在揭示表格与其上下文之间的深层语义关联，支持高级任务如跨段落数据解释和上下文一致性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注表格的表面任务（如布局分析、数据提取），缺乏对表格深层语义及其上下文关联的解析，限制了高级任务的应用。

Method: DOTABLER通过定制数据集和预训练模型的领域微调，构建完整的解析流程，识别与表格语义相关的上下文片段。

Result: 在近4000页真实PDF文档（含1000多个表格）的评估中，DOTABLER的Precision和F1分数均超过90%，性能优于GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: DOTABLER在表格语义分析和深度文档解析方面表现出色，为表格为中心的语义分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec通过频谱视角平衡语义和协同信息，解决了LLM推荐系统中协同信号衰减的问题，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统过度依赖语义关联，导致协同信号在传播过程中衰减，影响性能。

Method: 采用全局图低通滤波器（G-LPF）净化嵌入，并通过时域频率调制（TFM）逐层保留协同信号。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FreLLM4Rec性能提升高达8.00%（NDCG@10）。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec为LLM推荐系统提供了一种平衡语义和协同信息的有效方法。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索软提示在多语言任务中的潜力，特别是针对低性能语言，这些语言即使在完全微调下表现也较差。

Method: 引入XPE，结合轻量级编码架构和多源训练，以及双软提示机制，结合编码器生成的提示和直接训练的软提示。

Result: 在SIB-200基准测试中，XPE对低性能语言效果显著，而混合机制在多语言场景中适应性更强。

Conclusion: XPE和双软提示机制为多语言任务提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，尤其适用于低性能语言。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

Motivation: 使大语言模型能够以韩语进行原生推理，提升其在韩语任务中的表现，同时增强通用推理能力。

Method: 1. 第一阶段：监督微调（SFT）在高质量韩语推理数据集上；2. 第二阶段：采用强化学习（GRPO算法）进一步优化，引入oracle judge模型解决稳定性问题。

Result: 模型在韩语推理任务中表现显著提升，同时在数学和编程等高级推理任务中也有进步，且能完全以韩语进行内部思维链。

Conclusion: 两阶段微调方法有效提升了模型在韩语推理任务中的能力，并通过强化学习进一步优化了整体性能，解决了训练中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

Result: 性能提升10%，并能处理更复杂的任务，优于依赖翻译的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了高效替代方案，且多语言LLMs表现接近，但英语中心LLMs表现不佳。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Result: 在现代捷克语摘要数据集SumeCzech上取得最新最优结果，并引入历史捷克语数据集Posel od Čerchova。

Conclusion: 这些成果为捷克语文本摘要研究提供了新方向，特别是在历史文本处理方面。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了跨语言情感分析的性能，为实际应用提供了实用建议。

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

Method: 提出MDH框架，结合LLM和少量人工监督，用于数据集清理和越狱响应检测；提出D-Attack和DH-CoT两种新攻击策略。

Result: MDH框架有效平衡了准确性和效率；D-Attack和DH-CoT显著提高了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: MDH框架和两种新攻击策略为恶意内容检测和越狱攻击评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Conclusion: SFPF提供了一种新的红队策略，但其效果因提示和层而异，通用性需进一步验证。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

Result: 在四个长上下文叙事基准测试中，ComoRAG性能优于基线RAG方法，相对提升达11%。

Conclusion: ComoRAG为复杂查询提供全局理解优势，是一种基于认知启发的状态推理范式。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

Motivation: 中文成语的翻译因其比喻意义与字面意义不同而具有挑战性，但现有机器翻译系统在此方面表现不佳，缺乏系统评估。

Method: 构建IdiomEval框架，标注900个翻译对，涵盖9个现代系统（如GPT-4和Google翻译）和4个领域（网页、新闻、维基百科和社交媒体）。

Result: 现有系统在成语翻译中错误率高，最佳系统GPT-4错误率为28%；现有评估指标与人工评分相关性低（Pearson<0.48）。

Conclusion: 提出改进模型，错误检测F1分数达0.68，为中文成语翻译提供更优评估方法。

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算成本高昂，限制了其应用。研究旨在通过经济学原理优化计算资源分配，提高效率。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将LLMs视为资源受限的代理（注意力头和神经元块）的经济体，通过激励驱动的训练范式（结合任务损失和计算成本项）实现稀疏和高效激活。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103任务上，该方法显著减少了FLOPS（约40%）和延迟，同时保持了准确性，并生成了更可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: 经济原理为在严格资源约束下设计高效、自适应且透明的LLMs提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Motivation: 近年来，可解释性和隐私保护的NLP研究增多，但两者交叉领域的研究不足，缺乏对两者关系的深入理解。

Method: 采用差分隐私（DP）和后验可解释性方法，实证研究NLP中的隐私与可解释性权衡。

Result: 研究发现隐私与可解释性之间存在复杂关系，受下游任务性质、文本私有化方法和可解释性方法选择等因素影响。

Conclusion: 隐私与可解释性可以共存，研究总结了未来工作的实用建议。

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多种任务中表现优异，但存在文本主导问题，即过度依赖文本而忽视其他模态。本文旨在系统研究这一问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了两种评估指标（MDI和AEI）来衡量模态不平衡，并通过实验分析文本主导的成因，提出令牌压缩方法以优化模型注意力分配。

Result: 研究发现文本主导问题在所有测试模态中普遍存在，提出的令牌压缩方法显著降低了MDI值（如LLaVA-7B从10.23降至0.86）。

Conclusion: 本文为开发更均衡的多模态语言模型提供了分析框架和方法，揭示了文本主导问题的成因并提出了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Motivation: 当前基于标量奖励的个性化方法反馈弱，限制了学习效率和个性化质量。

Method: VAC框架通过NLF提供丰富监督信号，交替优化反馈模型和策略模型。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，人类评估也证实生成回答质量更高。

Conclusion: NLF为优化个性化问答提供了更有效的信号。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

Motivation: 传统LLMs的前缀提示和顺序生成限制了双向信息的灵活性，dLLMs的双向机制和迭代优化提供了新机会。

Method: 提出ICE框架，结合原位提示和置信度感知的提前退出机制，优化dLLMs的提示策略。

Conclusion: ICE为dLLMs提供高效灵活的原位提示方法，显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在序列决策任务中潜力巨大，但依赖大规模模型限制了其应用。现有后训练方法无法处理多步任务中的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出MS-GRPO算法，基于TSMG和LAP框架，通过将累积奖励分配到每一步，并结合优势加权采样策略。

Result: 在Snake和Frozen Lake任务中，3B参数模型后训练后性能提升，优于72B参数基线50%。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练是替代模型规模扩展的有效方法，可高效提升LLMs在序列决策任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Conclusion: LLMs能有效利用内部知识，SSRL减少了幻觉现象，且与外部搜索引擎无缝集成，为RL训练提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

Abstract: AI systems for software development are rapidly gaining prominence, yet
significant challenges remain in ensuring their safety. To address this, Amazon
launched the Trusted AI track of the Amazon Nova AI Challenge, a global
competition among 10 university teams to drive advances in secure AI. In the
challenge, five teams focus on developing automated red teaming bots, while the
other five create safe AI assistants. This challenge provides teams with a
unique platform to evaluate automated red-teaming and safety alignment methods
through head-to-head adversarial tournaments where red teams have multi-turn
conversations with the competing AI coding assistants to test their safety
alignment. Along with this, the challenge provides teams with a feed of high
quality annotated data to fuel iterative improvement. Throughout the challenge,
teams developed state-of-the-art techniques, introducing novel approaches in
reasoning-based safety alignment, robust model guardrails, multi-turn
jail-breaking, and efficient probing of large language models (LLMs). To
support these efforts, the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team made substantial
scientific and engineering investments, including building a custom baseline
coding specialist model for the challenge from scratch, developing a tournament
orchestration service, and creating an evaluation harness. This paper outlines
the advancements made by university teams and the Amazon Nova AI Challenge team
in addressing the safety challenges of AI for software development,
highlighting this collaborative effort to raise the bar for AI safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台上虚假信息的广泛传播对信息完整性构成重大挑战，需要高效检测方法。

Method: 系统结合四种智能体：机器学习代理（逻辑回归）、维基百科知识检查代理（命名实体识别）、一致性检测代理（LLM提示工程）和网络数据抓取分析代理（关系三元组提取），通过模型上下文协议（MCP）协调。

Result: 多智能体系统准确率达95.3%，F1分数0.964，显著优于传统方法。加权聚合方法优于算法阈值优化。

Conclusion: 模块化架构使系统易于扩展，同时保留决策过程细节，为虚假信息检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究代理（DRAs）多为闭源系统，缺乏开源选择。本文旨在比较开源ODR与专有系统的性能，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过调整BrowseComp基准为BC-Small，测试ODR和两个专有系统（Anthropic和Google），并对ODR进行三项改进，提出ODR+模型。

Result: 初始测试中所有系统准确率为0%，改进后的ODR+在BC-Small上达到10%的成功率，优于其他系统。

Conclusion: ODR+通过三项改进显著提升了性能，为开源DRAs提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LCPO的方法，通过平衡隐式奖励和NLL损失，显著减少大型推理模型的输出长度，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）的长推理链增加了计算成本并可能导致过度思考，现有方法在平衡推理效率和质量方面存在不足。

Method: 分析生成路径分布并通过难度估计筛选轨迹，研究偏好优化方法的收敛行为，提出LCPO方法直接平衡隐式奖励与NLL损失。

Result: 实验表明，LCPO在多个基准测试中将平均输出长度减少50%以上，同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了在有限数据和训练下引导LRMs高效推理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: KompeteAI是一个新型AutoML框架，通过动态解决方案空间探索和检索增强生成（RAG）解决现有LLM-based AutoML系统的探索局限和执行瓶颈，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略单一和执行效率低下的问题，限制了其性能。

Method: KompeteAI引入动态解决方案空间探索，结合MCTS和合并阶段，并利用RAG扩展假设空间；通过预测评分模型和加速调试方法优化执行效率。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench基准测试中平均性能提升3%，管道评估速度提升6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法显著提升了AutoML的性能和效率，并提出了新的基准测试Kompete-bench。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过引入事件熵势的概念，量化离散事件对系统未来熵的影响，以提升AI系统的不确定性建模能力。

Method: 将物理学中的熵势概念调整到AI领域，提出事件中心度量，并形式化定义，强调条件期望以考虑反事实场景。

Result: 展示了熵势框架在策略评估、内在奖励设计、可解释AI和异常检测中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 熵势框架为AI中的不确定性管理提供了理论基础，结合了热力学、信息论和机器学习的原理。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中取得了进展，但存在过度思考问题，导致效率降低。现有方法需要预设预算或选择推理模式，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出VSRM机制，根据推理轨迹中中间状态的表现分配奖励，结合PPO和Reinforce++进行实验。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25等数学推理基准测试中，VSRM显著减少了输出长度，同时保持了推理性能，有效抑制了无效步骤。

Conclusion: VSRM通过奖励有效步骤和惩罚无效步骤，从根本上缓解了过度思考问题，平衡了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant

TL;DR: HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G通过动态分配KL阈值优化了多智能体强化学习中的策略更新，提升了性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HATRPO中固定KL阈值可能导致更新缓慢和局部最优，尤其在异构智能体环境中。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W（基于KKT优化全局KL约束）和HATRPO-G（基于贪婪算法按改进-散度比分配阈值）。

Result: 实验显示两种方法显著提升HATRPO性能，收敛更快，最终奖励提高超22.5%，且HATRPO-W更稳定。

Conclusion: 动态KL阈值分配在多智能体强化学习中有效，HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G为异构环境提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的想象力推理提供了新见解，并为未来探索性代理行为研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Result: 在四个 QA 基准测试中表现优异，响应质量显著提升，检索冗余减少 46%。

Conclusion: LeanRAG 通过优化知识聚合和检索策略，有效提升了 RAG 的性能和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Conclusion: HiRef通过层次结构和稀疏化优化，显著提升了药物推荐的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We-Math 2.0是一个统一系统，通过结构化数学知识体系、模型中心数据空间建模和强化学习训练范式，提升多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据集构建和方法优化，忽视了知识驱动设计和数据空间建模。

Method: 构建五层次数学知识系统，开发标准与专业数据集，提出两阶段强化学习框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显示出数学推理的泛化能力。

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过综合设计显著提升了数学推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出FIRESPARQL框架，通过微调LLM和结合RAG技术，解决SKG问答中SPARQL查询生成的结构和语义错误，实验显示微调效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在SKG问答中生成SPARQL查询时的结构和语义错误问题。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和SPARQL查询修正层，并在SciQA基准上评估多种配置。

Result: 微调配置表现最佳，ROUGE-L达0.90，RelaxedEM达0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架有效提升SKG问答中SPARQL查询的准确性和结果质量。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的空间查询系统SEQ-GPT，用于通过自然语言实现更灵活的空间示例查询（SEQ）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的空间服务（如在线地图）主要依赖用户查询进行位置搜索，但在执行复杂任务（如同时搜索多个相关位置）时用户体验受限。

Method: 引入SEQ-GPT系统，利用LLM的自然语言处理能力，支持交互式操作（如澄清查询细节和动态调整搜索），并提出一种定制的LLM适配流程，通过对话合成和多模型协作将自然语言与结构化空间数据对齐。

Result: SEQ-GPT为扩展空间搜索提供了端到端的解决方案，并在实际数据和场景中进行了验证。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT展示了利用LLM提升空间查询灵活性和用户体验的潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DxDirector-7B，一种能够主导全流程临床诊断的AI，减少医生工作量并提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在临床诊断中仅作为辅助工具，无法主导从模糊主诉开始的完整诊断流程，限制了其减轻医生负担和提升效率的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B，一种具备深度思考能力的大语言模型，能够主导全流程诊断，并建立责任框架。

Result: DxDirector-7B在罕见、复杂和真实案例中表现优异，显著降低医生工作量并提高诊断准确性。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从辅助工具转变为诊断主导者，为高效精准诊断提供新方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

TL;DR: PASS是一个多模态框架，通过概率采样和自适应工具选择解决医疗AI中的黑盒推理、多模态整合和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在医疗领域存在黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和效率低下的问题。

Method: PASS通过多工具图采样、概率标注路径和动态推理优化，结合三阶段训练方法。

Result: PASS在多个指标上显著优于基线，同时平衡计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS为医疗AI提供了可解释、自适应和多模态的新范式。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型（LM）与人类偏好对齐的问题，提出静态和动态偏好数据在优化中的效果差异，并引入对齐阶段假设来解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型与人类偏好的对齐对构建可靠AI系统至关重要，但现有方法（如DPO）在静态和动态偏好数据上的效果存在差异。

Method: 提出对齐阶段假设，将对齐过程分为偏好注入和偏好微调两个阶段，并通过理论和实验分析验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，动态数据在某些模型（如Llama-3）上效果显著优于静态数据，而在其他模型（如Zephyr）上则相反。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了对齐阶段的重要性，并提出了一种有效算法来识别阶段边界，为未来LM对齐方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现有限，主要因训练注释中的估计误差（高方差）而受阻。

Method: 提出ComMCS方法，通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡洛估计器，构建无偏估计器以减少方差。

Result: 在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中，ComMCS表现优于回归优化方法（提升2.8分）和无方差减少基线（提升2.2分）。

Conclusion: ComMCS方法有效降低了估计误差的方差，提升了LLMs在复杂推理任务中的性能，且无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Motivation: 现有方法在多属性控制中易产生干扰和权衡问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明MSRS显著减少属性冲突，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多样化任务。

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性控制提供了高效且通用的框架。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统难以有效整合外部知识图谱信息，导致推荐结果与用户期望不符。

Method: STEP采用三阶段课程逐步对齐对话上下文与知识图谱实体，并通过双提示方案（对话前缀和推荐前缀）注入冻结语言模型。

Result: STEP在两个公共数据集上的推荐精度和对话质量优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过上下文-知识融合和双提示方案，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like

Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention

Conclusion: 为处理现实中的大规模广义规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，其带来的错误信息风险增加。现有研究多关注内容真实性，而较少探讨其对人类行为的影响。

Method: 引入MhAIM数据集（含154,552个帖子，其中111,153为AI生成），提出信任度、影响力和开放性三个新指标，并开发T-Lens系统（基于HR-MCP协议）。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM提供了人类感知能力的实证工具，提出了减轻AI错误信息风险的可操作策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否通过数据与参数扩展获得结构化、可泛化的内部表征。

Method: 引入临床试验自然语言推理基准测试（四种推理类型），并设计GKMRV探针区分知识获取与推理失败。评估六种当代LLM在直接和链式思维提示下的表现。

Result: 模型在知识获取（GKMRV）上表现优异（平均准确率0.918），但在推理任务中表现差（平均准确率0.25），输出推理高度一致（0.87），表明依赖启发式方法。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏结构化内部表征，无法可靠部署知识，GKMRV框架为高风险领域LLM可靠性评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在关键决策中的应用增加，可解释性成为提升理解和用户选择的关键，但对视觉障碍用户的可访问性研究不足。

Method: 采用文献综述（79项研究）和四部分概念验证（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）分析XAI的可访问性。

Result: 初步发现简化解释对非视觉用户更易理解，多模态展示能提升公平可解释性。

Conclusion: XAI需更多关注视觉障碍用户的可访问性，简化解释和多模态展示是改进方向。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable
patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in
pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized
state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a
foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation
recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom
fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We
present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological
data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss
functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation without patient-individual training.

TL;DR: VR课程在提升空间推理能力方面与传统课程效果相当，但更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VR作为教学工具的潜力，尤其是针对空间推理能力的提升，并比较其与传统方法的差异。

Method: 将现有纸质课程模块改编为VR课程，结合教育支架和实时反馈，通过定量和定性方法评估效果。

Result: VR课程显著提升空间推理能力，效果与传统课程相当，但时间更短；学生反馈积极。

Conclusion: VR是教授空间推理的高效工具，效果与传统方法相当且更省时。

Abstract: Background: Spatial reasoning has been identified as a critical skill for
success in STEM. Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower
incoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not
widely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for
teaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete
spatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has
developed or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:
We seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both
in isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to
traditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing
pencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time
feedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with
$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative
spatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated
assessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We
also compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using
data collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took
our VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no
significant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120
minutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes
each), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR.
We observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most
students reported enjoying learning in VR.

Conclusion: ParseJargon为个性化术语支持工具设计提供见解，适用于跨学科与教育领域。

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.

keynote, panel discussions, and interactive breakout groups for discussion and
hands-on protocol design and tool prototyping sessions. We seek to foster a
community around longitudinal system research and promote it as a more embraced
method for designing, building, and evaluating UIST tools.

Result: 指出AI可能通过AE实现类似人类的情感行为，但目前缺乏明确的实现框架。

Conclusion: AE可能对未来的AI发展有益，但需解决伦理和安全风险。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has enabled Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to
recognise, interpret, and respond to human emotions - a capability also known
as Artificial Emotional Intelligence (AEI). It is increasingly seen as an
important component of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We discuss
whether in order to peruse this goal, AI benefits from moving beyond emotion
recognition and synthesis to develop internal emotion-like states, which we
term as Artificial Emotion (AE). This shift potentially allows AI to benefit
from the paradigm of `inner emotions' in ways we - as humans - do. Although
recent research shows early signs that AI systems may exhibit AE-like
behaviours, a clear framework for how emotions can be realised in AI remains
underexplored. In this paper, we discuss potential advantages of AE in AI,
review current manifestations of AE in machine learning systems, examine
emotion-modulated architectures, and summarise mechanisms for modelling and
integrating AE into future AI. We also explore the ethical implications and
safety risks associated with `emotional' AGI, while concluding with our opinion
on how AE could be beneficial in the future.

Motivation: 随着GenAI在教育中的应用增加，理解SRL在GenAI工具交互中的动态性变得至关重要，以支持学习者的自我调节能力。

Method: 使用隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）分析高等教育学生在GenAI辅助学术写作中的数字痕迹数据，将SRL建模为分层系统。

Result: 识别出三种不同的SRL策略群体，这些群体在任务表现上存在显著差异，表明SRL策略的使用影响学习成果。

Conclusion: 研究为建模SRL提供了新方法，并为设计适应性学习技术以支持GenAI增强的教育环境提供了依据。

Abstract: The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into education is reshaping how
students learn, making self-regulated learning (SRL) - the ability to plan,
monitor, and adapt one's learning - more important than ever. To support
learners in these new contexts, it is essential to understand how SRL unfolds
during interaction with GenAI tools. Learning analytics offers powerful
techniques for analyzing digital trace data to infer SRL behaviors. However,
existing approaches often assume SRL processes are linear, segmented, and
non-overlapping-assumptions that overlook the dynamic, recursive, and
non-linear nature of real-world learning. We address this by conceptualizing
SRL as a layered system: observable learning patterns reflect hidden tactics
(short, purposeful action states), which combine into broader SRL strategies.
Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), we analyzed trace data from higher education
students engaged in GenAI-assisted academic writing. We identified three
distinct groups of learners, each characterized by different SRL strategies.
These groups showed significant differences in performance, indicating that
students' use of different SRL strategies in GenAI-assisted writing led to
varying task outcomes. Our findings advance the methodological toolkit for
modeling SRL and inform the design of adaptive learning technologies that more
effectively support learners in GenAI-enhanced educational environments.

Result: inter-BRPD以更少的参数捕捉脑力劳动，统计验证其可靠性和有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为概念设计支持工具的开发提供了新视角。

Abstract: Conceptual design is a cognitively complex task, especially in the
engineering design of products having relative motion between components.
Designers prefer sketching as a medium for conceptual design and use gestures
and annotations to represent such relative motion. Literature suggests that
static representations of motion in sketches may not achieve the intended
functionality when realised, because it primarily depends on the designers'
mental capabilities for motion simulation. Thus, it is important to understand
the cognitive phenomena when designers are exploring concepts of articulated
products. The current work is an attempt to understand design neurocognition by
categorising the tasks and measuring the mental effort involved in these tasks
using EEG. The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to
support the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based
metric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to
quantify mental effort. A design experiment is conducted with 32 participants,
where they have to perform one control task and 2 focus tasks corresponding to
the motion exploration task (MET) and the concept generation task (CGT),
respectively. EEG data is recorded during the 3 tasks, cleaned, processed and
analysed using the MNE library in Python. It is observed from the results that
inter-BRPD captures the essence of mental effort with half the number of
conventionally used parameters. The reliability and efficacy of the inter-BRPD
metric are also statistically validated against literature-based cognitive
metrics. With these new insights, the study opens up possibilities for creating
support for conceptual design and its evaluation.

Understanding the communication strategies that creators use in these videos
and how they affect viewers' engagement can help spread beauty knowledge. By
coding 352 beauty videos in Rednote, this study presents a comprehensive
taxonomy of communication strategies used by the creators, such as using home
as the video background and displaying makeup effects when starting the
narrative at the beginning. We further label and computationally classify six
categories of comments that reveal viewers' engagement with beauty videos. The
regression analyses reveal the effects of beauty video communication strategies
on viewers' engagement; for example, calling viewers to take action at the end
tends to attract more comments that debate the product's efficacy. We discuss
insights into fostering the creation of beauty videos and the communication of
beauty knowledge.

Result: 14个实际案例验证了方法的有效性，展示了LLM在OSC开发中的潜力。

Conclusion: MCP2OSC为多媒体设备提供了一种基于LLM的通用控制机制，兼具灵活性和精确性。

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly
processing and generating human-readable OSC messages. The results suggest its
potential for a LLM-based universal control mechanism for multimedia devices.

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multi-modal, interdisciplinary field
focused on designing, studying, and improving the interactions between people
and computer systems. This involves the design of systems that can recognize,
interpret, and respond to human emotions or stress. Developing systems to
monitor and react to stressful events can help prevent severe health
implications caused by long-term stress exposure. Currently, the publicly
available datasets and standardized protocols for data collection in this
domain are limited. Therefore, we introduce a multi-modal dataset intended for
wearable affective computing research, specifically the development of
automated stress recognition systems. We systematically review the publicly
available datasets recorded in controlled laboratory settings. Based on a
proposed framework for the standardization of stress experiments and data
collection, we collect physiological and motion signals from wearable devices
(e.g., electrodermal activity, photoplethysmography, three-axis accelerometer).
During the experimental protocol, we differentiate between the following four
affective/activity states: neutral, physical, cognitive stress, and
socio-evaluative stress. These different phases are meticulously labeled,
allowing for detailed analysis and reconstruction of each experiment. Meta-data
such as body positions, locations, and rest phases are included as further
annotations. In addition, we collect psychological self-assessments after each
stressor to evaluate subjects' affective states. The contributions of this
paper are twofold: 1) a novel multi-modal, publicly available dataset for
automated stress recognition, and 2) a benchmark for stress detection with 89\%
in a binary classification (baseline vs. stress) and 82\% in a multi-class
classification (baseline vs. stress vs. physical exercise).

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

Conclusion: 不同生理指标反映不同空间行为特征，为虚拟环境中的社交行为评估和设计提供依据。

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social
interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.
While previous research has established that users respond to personal space
violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific
physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain
understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to
personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening
facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence
these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design
manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression
(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart
rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were
individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR
responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the
approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged
proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing
than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,
reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort
ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that
different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic
responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV
responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing
comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual
environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.

Abstract: The increasing integration of automation in vehicles aims to enhance both
safety and comfort, but it also introduces new risks, including driver
disengagement, reduced situation awareness, and mode confusion. In this work,
we propose the DEV framework, a closed-loop framework for risk-aware adaptive
driving automation that captures the dynamic interplay between the driver, the
environment, and the vehicle. The framework promotes to continuously adjusting
the operational level of automation based on a risk management strategy. The
real-time risk assessment supports smoother transitions and effective
cooperation between the driver and the automation system. Furthermore, we
introduce a nomenclature of indexes corresponding to each core component,
namely driver involvement, environment complexity, and vehicle engagement, and
discuss how their interaction influences driving risk. The DEV framework offers
a comprehensive perspective to align multidisciplinary research efforts and
guide the development of dynamic, risk-aware driving automation systems.

Method: 参与者驾驶六种场景，结合认知分心（有无心算任务）和交通复杂性（三种条件），自由使用ACC。分析SCL、SCR振幅和SCR率。

Result: 认知分心和ACC使用显著影响所有EDA指标；交通复杂性影响SCL和SCR振幅，但不影响SCR率。

Conclusion: EDA指标能反映驾驶员因认知分心、交通条件和自动化使用引起的心理负荷变化。

Abstract: In this simulator study, we investigate whether and how electrodermal
activity (EDA) reflects driver cognitive distraction under varying traffic
conditions and adaptive cruise control (ACC) use. Participants drove in six
scenarios, combining two levels of cognitive distraction (presence/absence of a
mental calculation task) and three levels of driving environment complexity
(different traffic conditions). Throughout the experiment, they were free to
activate or deactivate ACC (ACC use, two levels). We analyzed three EDA-based
indicators of cognitive distraction: SCL (mean skin conductance level), SCR
amplitude (mean amplitude of skin conductance responses), and SCR rate (rate of
skin conductance responses). Results indicate that all three indicators were
significantly influenced by cognitive distraction and ACC use, while
environment complexity influenced SCL and SCR amplitude, but not SCR rate.
These findings suggest that EDA-based indicators reflect variations in drivers'
mental workload due not only to cognitive distraction, but also to driving
environment and automation use.

three levels of driving environment complexity. Throughout the experiment,
participants were free to activate or deactivate an ACC. We analyzed two
gaze-based indicators of driver cognitive distraction: the percent road center,
and the gaze dispersions (horizontal and vertical). Our results show that
vertical gaze dispersion increases with traffic complexity, while ACC use leads
to gaze concentration toward the road center. Cognitive distraction reduces
road center gaze and increases vertical dispersion. Complementary analyses
revealed that these observations actually arise mainly between mental
calculations, while periods of mental calculations are characterized by a
temporary increase in gaze concentration.

TL;DR: ParcoursVis是一种渐进式视觉分析工具，用于大规模探索电子健康记录序列，通过渐进算法快速显示近似结果并逐步优化，支持处理数千万患者的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具因处理整个数据集的时间限制，无法满足大规模数据的交互需求，ParcoursVis旨在突破这一限制，支持探索罕见医疗条件或意外患者路径。

Method: 采用渐进算法，初始显示近似聚合结果的Icicle树，并逐步优化，同时保持交互性。

Result: ParcoursVis可处理数千万患者的数据，比类似系统多3-5个数量级，已在两个大型真实医疗数据集上应用。

Conclusion: ParcoursVis通过渐进式方法实现了大规模数据的交互式探索，为可视化设计师提供了可扩展系统的开发指南。

Abstract: We present ParcoursVis, a Progressive Visual Analytics tool designed to
explore electronic health record sequences of patients at scale. Existing tools
process and aggregate the whole dataset upfront before showing the
visualization, taking a time proportional to the data size. Therefore, to
remain interactive, existing tools are limited to data sizes that can be
processed in under a few seconds to meet the latency constraints of human
attention. To overcome this limitation and scale to larger sizes, ParcoursVis
relies on a progressive algorithm that quickly shows an approximate initial
result of the aggregation, visualized as an Icicle tree, and improves it
iteratively, updating the visualization until the whole computation is done.
With its architecture, ParcoursVis remains interactive while visualizing the
sequences of tens of millions of patients, each described with thousands of
events; three to five orders of magnitude more than similar systems. Managing
large datasets allows for exploring rare medical conditions or unexpected
patient pathways, contributing to improving treatments. We describe the
algorithms we use and our evaluation concerning their scalability, convergence,
and stability. We also report on a set of guidelines to support visualization
designers in developing scalable progressive systems. ParcoursVis already
allows practitioners to perform analyses on two large real medical datasets.
Our prototype is open-source.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了重新安置人群在门诊医疗中的挑战，提出通过参与式设计工作坊识别社区资产，并设计基于优势的技术解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新安置人群在医疗中面临文化、语言和社会经济障碍，现有研究多关注问题而非社区优势。

Method: 通过两次社区参与式设计工作坊，与30名苗族社区成员合作，识别社区资产。

Result: 识别出四种社区资产，如代际健康支持和基于故事的沟通方式。

Conclusion: 参与式设计可促进基于优势的方法，为技术设计提供启示，支持门诊健康管理。

Abstract: Individuals resettled in a new environment often face challenges in accessing
adequate healthcare services, particularly within the complex processes of
outpatient clinic care. Cultural differences, language barriers, and low
socioeconomic status contribute to these difficulties. While previous studies
have identified barriers and proposed technology-mediated solutions for
resettled populations, many focus on addressing deficits rather than building
on the strengths these communities already possess, which limits the
sustainability and relevance of these solutions in everyday life. We conducted
two community-based participatory design workshops with 30 Hmong community
members in a large metropolitan area in the US. Through this process, we
identified four types of assets the community has gradually developed,
including intergenerational support for health management and
storytelling-based communication practices that facilitate relatable and
culturally grounded interactions. We show how participatory design workshops
can foster asset-based approaches, and discuss design implications for
technologies that leverage patients' existing strengths to support their health
management during outpatient visits.

*Daniel Groos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenFPL是一个开源工具，用于预测Fantasy Premier League球员表现，基于公开数据，性能媲美商业服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业预测工具依赖专有数据且不透明，OpenFPL旨在通过公开数据提供高精度预测，降低参与门槛。

Method: 使用2020-21至2023-24赛季的公开数据，开发位置特定的集成模型。

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季测试中表现与商业服务相当，对高回报球员预测更优。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供长期规划和短期决策支持，推动了预测工具的民主化。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管表格数据推断是现代技术和科学的基础，但其最佳实践仍主要基于GBDTs，缺乏创新。xRFM旨在结合神经网络和特征学习的最新进展，提升性能。

Method: xRFM结合特征学习核机器与树结构，适应数据的局部结构并支持大规模训练数据。

Result: 在100个回归数据集和200个分类数据集上，xRFM性能最佳或与最佳方法相当，优于GBDTs。

Conclusion: xRFM不仅性能优越，还通过平均梯度外积提供原生可解释性。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球性身体活动不足问题，探索移动健康（mHealth）干预的潜力，尤其是结合行为科学的个性化方法。

Method: 通过四臂随机对照试验（控制组、随机组、固定组和RL组），评估RL算法在Fitbit应用中个性化推送PA提示的效果。

Result: RL组在1个月和2个月时的日均步数显著高于其他组，且效果持续。

Conclusion: 行为科学指导的RL方法在个性化数字健康干预中具有潜力。

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求规划者更看重预测的稳定性和一致性，而非仅追求准确性增量提升。模型预测的大幅波动会增加人工干预，降低对ML模型的信任。

Method: 研究了模型诱导的随机性，量化了固定输入下单一模型预测的方差，并通过案例研究评估了多种先进模型的稳定性和准确性。

Result: 集成模型在不显著降低（甚至提升）准确性的情况下提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步研究生产系统中部署模型的预测稳定性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对扩散模型的首个约束解码方法，能够处理上下文无关文法定义的形式语言，解决了现有方法不适用于扩散LLMs的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的生成结果不一定符合形式语言的语法约束，而现有约束解码方法不适用于扩散LLMs，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将约束解码问题转化为更一般的加法填充问题，并进一步简化为判断目标语言与正则语言交集是否为空的任务，提出了一种高效的上下文无关语言处理算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在C++代码填充和JSON结构化数据提取等应用中，几乎完美地实现了语法正确性，同时保持或提高了功能正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了扩散LLMs的约束解码问题，还通过效率优化确保了计算开销的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Result: 小型LLMs能解决图任务并泛化到新结构和任务。

Conclusion: LLMs在图任务中具有潜力，无需专用编码器即可泛化。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Method: 提出CAD-RL框架，结合CoT引导的冷启动和目标驱动的强化学习，使用三种任务特定奖励（可执行性、几何精度和外部评估），并引入三种优化策略（信任区域拉伸、精度令牌损失和过长过滤）。

Result: 实验表明，CAD-RL在推理质量、输出精度和代码可执行性上显著优于现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）。

Conclusion: CAD-RL为自动化CAD建模提供了有效解决方案，并通过ExeCAD数据集支持训练和基准测试。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Motivation: 解决标准ReFT框架中因多步推理导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 利用目标模型的部分层作为行为模型生成离策略补全，动态跳过层以减少推理成本。

Result: 在数学推理任务中提高了计算效率（tokens/sec），同时性能与基线ReFT相当。

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT通过优化计算效率，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Conclusion: 结果表明，将预训练目标与理论支持的嵌入几何对齐具有显著优势。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-200上表现优异，AUROC和FPR95指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能优越，还能通过反事实解释提供结果的可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Conclusion: 基准测试可作为训练课程，而非单纯测试集，其新颖性是衡量推理模型泛化能力的关键。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

TL;DR: AI分析象牙上的手写标记，为打击非法象牙贸易提供低成本、可扩展的取证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法象牙贸易导致非洲象数量持续下降，而现有的DNA取证方法成本高且有时不可行。手写标记虽易获取，但鲜少被分析。

Method: 利用AI驱动的流程，从6,085张象牙照片中提取17,000多个手写标记，通过目标检测模型和先进AI工具分析，识别出184个重复标记。

Result: 发现20个标记出现在多次查获的象牙中，建立了不同查获事件之间的关联。

Conclusion: AI手写分析填补了其他取证方法的不足，展示了AI在野生动物取证中的潜力，为打击有组织犯罪提供了新工具。

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

TL;DR: 研究通过局部谷（LV）中心方法评估D-Wave量子退火器在受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）采样中的表现，发现其与经典Gibbs采样在局部谷数量和能量上存在差异，但未显著提升采样质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子退火器在RBM采样中的潜力，尤其是对比经典Gibbs采样，以验证其是否能提升采样质量。

Method: 使用D-Wave量子退火器和经典Gibbs采样从训练好的RBM中获取样本，比较局部谷数量和能量。

Result: D-Wave采样在局部谷数量上略优于Gibbs采样，但两者发现的局部谷差异较大，且在高概率状态下重叠较多。

Conclusion: D-Wave采样未显著提升RBM采样质量，但结合经典与量子方法可能有改进潜力。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种可解释的机器学习模型，用于预测肝硬化危重患者的早期急性肾损伤（AKI），LightGBM表现最佳，具有高准确性和负预测值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者中AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足且难以融入ICU工作流程，因此需要开发更有效的预测方法。

Method: 研究基于MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库，筛选1240名肝硬化ICU患者，提取48小时内实验室和生理数据，通过预处理、特征选择和算法训练（包括LightGBM等6种模型）进行预测。

Result: LightGBM表现最佳（AUROC 0.808，准确率0.704，NPV 0.911），关键预测因子包括部分凝血活酶时间延长、pH值低等。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确预测肝硬化ICU患者的早期AKI风险，高负预测值支持低风险患者的安全降级，且具有临床可解释性，需进一步外部验证和系统集成。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BCI因神经信号漂移和用户差异导致的准确性下降问题，减少频繁校准的负担。

Method: EDAPT先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT均优于静态方法，运行高效，更新速度快。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实用路径，降低了部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Motivation: 研究ICL在密码学领域的潜力，尤其是如何通过少量示例推断隐藏的加密映射。

Method: 利用Transformer模型，通过少量（密文，明文）对学习密码函数，无需参数更新。

Result: 模型能够成功推断出单字母替换和Vigenère密码的映射关系，并解码新密文。

Conclusion: ICL在密码函数学习中表现出色，展示了Transformer在结构化推理任务中的强大能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练的Transformer后门攻击方法HPMI，通过剪枝和注入恶意头部实现高效隐蔽攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法依赖重新训练或修改模型架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强，HPMI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HPMI通过剪枝最不重要的头部并注入预训练的恶意头部，无需重新训练或修改架构。

Result: 实验表明HPMI在保持清洁精度损失极小的同时，攻击成功率达99.55%，并能绕过四种先进防御机制。

Conclusion: HPMI在隐蔽性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，对清洁精度影响极小，为后门攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators

uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该方法支持基于证据的左旋多巴剂量决策，优化症状控制并减少副作用，提高生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅性能优越，还能揭示跨试验和被试的功能一致性，其代码将公开。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Conclusion: FedKEI通过知识迁移和权重优化，显著提升了联邦学习在医疗任务中的适应能力。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: CLIP-Fed结合预聚合和后聚合防御策略，利用多模态大语言模型和频率分析构建服务器数据集，并通过原型对比损失和KL散度对齐全局模型与CLIP的知识。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT数据集上，CLIP-Fed平均降低ASR（2.03%和1.35%），同时提高MA（7.92%和0.48%）。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed在异构数据分布下有效防御后门攻击，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于福利的公平聚类方法，通过建模群体效用（距离和比例代表）并优化Rawlsian和Utilitarian目标，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平聚类方法可能导致不理想的结果，因此需要一种福利导向的新方法。

Method: 建模群体效用（距离和比例代表），提出两种优化目标（Rawlsian和Utilitarian），并设计新算法。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，新方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 福利导向的公平聚类方法更有效，能避免传统方法的缺陷。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多层次的IoMT入侵检测系统框架，能够检测零日攻击并区分已知和未知威胁，实验显示高准确性和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoMT设备易受网络攻击，传统集中式IDS因延迟和隐私问题不适用，需要本地化且高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多层次框架，首层使用元学习或OCC算法粗筛流量，后续层识别攻击类型和新颖性。

Result: 在CICIoMT2024数据集上达到99.77%准确率和97.8% F1分数，首层能高效检测零日攻击。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于资源受限的IoMT环境，能有效应对零日攻击和已知威胁。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Result: 实验验证了系统条件对学习速率和性能的关键影响，证明了编码方案在即时性能与长期可学习性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 本文首次严格描述了语义通信中的统计学习问题，并提出了平衡即时性能与适应能力的设计原则。

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

TL;DR: eMamba是一个专为边缘设备设计的硬件加速框架，用于部署Mamba模型，通过轻量级替代和近似操作提高效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在边缘设备上的部署缺乏优化的硬件加速框架，eMamba旨在填补这一空白。

Method: eMamba通过替换复杂归一化层、近似昂贵操作，并进行近似感知的神经架构搜索来优化Mamba模型。

Result: eMamba在多个数据集上表现优异，参数更少，延迟更低，吞吐量更高，功耗和能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: eMamba为边缘设备上的Mamba模型部署提供了高效且准确的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了首个统一的评估框架，用于评估个体倾向学习（ITL）方法是否真正捕捉到标注者行为模式，并提供了两种新指标：DIC和BAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估框架，无法验证其是否真正捕捉标注者个体倾向并提供有意义的解释分析。

Method: 提出两种新指标：DIC（量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力）和BAE（评估模型解释与标注者行为的一致性）。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了ITL评估的空白，为理解标注者行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: XQuant通过低比特量化和动态重构KV缓存，显著减少LLM推理的内存消耗，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理因内存占用和带宽需求大而效率低下，计算能力提升加剧了这一挑战。

Method: XQuant量化并缓存层输入激活X，动态重构Keys和Values，减少内存操作。XQuant-CL利用跨层相似性进一步压缩。

Result: XQuant实现7.7倍内存节省，困惑度损失<0.1；XQuant-CL达10倍节省，困惑度损失仅0.01。

Conclusion: XQuant利用硬件计算能力消除内存瓶颈，超越现有KV缓存量化方法，接近FP16精度。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

Motivation: 探索SAM在更一般的张量化或尺度不变模型中的行为，以弥补现有研究的不足。

Method: 利用尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念，并基于梯度流分析其演化。进一步提出DAS方法，显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为。

Result: 实验表明DAS在张量补全、噪声训练、模型压缩和参数高效微调中性能优于或与SAM相当，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS通过显式控制范数偏差，有效模拟了SAM的隐式正则化，提供了一种更高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

TL;DR: RealAC框架通过自动保持特征间的复杂依赖关系，生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以捕捉复杂非线性关系，且缺乏用户定制化。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实与反事实实例的特征联合分布，自动保持特征依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的特征。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果边分数、依赖保持分数和IM1现实性指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RealAC为因果感知和用户中心的反事实生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

<details>

Motivation: 解决GNN在临床应用中因不透明性导致的信任问题，现有解释方法多为全局且后验，缺乏局部细节。

Method: 通过结构化上下文向量和轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，结合解码器、自然语言生成和文本注入机制。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上保持分类准确性的同时，生成忠实于节点的解释。

Conclusion: X-Node在保持性能的同时，提供了可解释性，适用于高风险的临床决策。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

Motivation: 联邦图学习中非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡问题会损害模型性能，尤其是少数类别的识别能力。

Method: 提出GraphFedMIG框架，利用分层生成对抗网络和互信息引导机制，生成高价值少数类特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Result: 研究发现这些实践确实会引入混杂，影响推荐系统性能。

Conclusion: 论文提供了实际建议，帮助从业者减少或避免混杂因素的影响。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of

rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design

modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single

state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state

structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU网络的梯度解释通常噪声大且难以解释，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过牺牲忠实性来平滑解释。

Method: 引入光谱框架，系统分析平滑性与忠实性的权衡，并量化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献。

Result: 理论分析揭示了基于代理的平滑方法如何扭曲解释，并提出了“解释差距”的正式定义和测量。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了理论发现，为解释方法的设计提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ECOC方法依赖手动或随机生成的编码本，效率低且可能效果不佳。

Result: 在四个数据集上，所提模型对对抗攻击的鲁棒性优于两种基线方法。

Conclusion: 自动化编码本学习方法有效且优于传统方法。

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

TL;DR: MAGUS是一个模块化框架，通过解耦的认知和决策阶段统一多模态理解与生成，支持灵活扩展和高性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用需要任意模态间的理解和生成能力，但现有方法在灵活性和扩展性上受限。

Method: MAGUS采用两阶段设计：认知阶段由多角色LLM代理协作完成结构化理解与规划；决策阶段通过Growth-Aware Search机制协调LLM推理与扩散生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MAGUS优于现有方法，甚至在MME基准上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS通过模块化设计和多代理协作，实现了高效的多模态理解与生成，无需联合训练。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在解决组合优化问题时，尤其是在计算相变附近的最难基准测试中表现不佳，无法有效解冻刚性变量或逃离次优吸引盆地。

Method: 利用深度强化学习训练NMC的非局部转移策略，通过观察能量变化和局部最小能量景观几何作为奖励和状态。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可以显著提升NMC算法的性能，为解决组合优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Method: 引入耦合引导项促进扩散模型间的协调，并在每个扩散步骤中加入投影步骤以强制执行硬约束。

Result: 在图像对生成、物体操纵和多机器人运动规划中表现出改进的耦合效果和约束满足，计算成本低。

Conclusion: PCD有效实现了多扩散模型的约束联合生成，无需重新训练，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程强化学习任务中奖励稀疏和奖励不对齐的问题导致现有方法难以定义有效的即时奖励或容易产生次优策略。

Method: 提出了SWE-oriented RL框架，支持多轮交互和自定义奖励函数，并引入G-RA方法，仅在高层次奖励满足阈值时累积即时奖励。

Result: 实验表明，G-RA显著提高了任务完成率和修改率（如完成率从47.6%提升至93.8%），同时避免了奖励不对齐导致的策略退化。

Conclusion: G-RA方法在长时程强化学习中实现了平衡的奖励累积，为软件工程任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: 统一学习通过图表示和uGNN优化，有效提升了异构模型在医学影像中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，具有高效性和扩展性。

Conclusion: FreeGAD无需训练即可实现高性能的图异常检测，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Result: 提出的方法在保持通用假设的同时，显著提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过方差缩减技术，本文成功解决了MORL中策略梯度方法的样本效率问题，为复杂决策场景提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Conclusion: IRT-informed划分策略能更好理解模型偏差-方差权衡，提升验证效果。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖捷径学习，导致模型在真实场景中泛化能力差，且当前模态融合策略在多模态讽刺检测中存在不足。

Method: 构建MUStARD++$^{R}$数据集以消除捷径信号，并提出MCIB模型实现高效多模态融合。

Result: MCIB在不依赖捷径学习的情况下取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: MCIB通过改进模态融合策略和消除捷径信号，为复杂情感识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

TL;DR: SPHENIC是一种结合空间持久同调的空间转录组聚类方法，通过优化空间嵌入和拓扑特征，显著提升了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在空间转录组聚类中存在拓扑信号质量低和空间邻域信息建模不足的问题。

Method: SPHENIC通过引入拓扑特征和设计SCDOM模块，优化空间嵌入和邻域相似性。

Result: 在14个基准数据集上，SPHENIC比现有方法性能提升3.31%-6.54%。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过整合拓扑和空间信息，显著提升了空间转录组聚类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖变化对地球系统过程有重要影响，但目前预测能力滞后于其他领域。

Method: 采用扩散模型进行十年尺度的不透水地表预测，并与无变化基线进行比较。

Result: 在12个大都市区的测试中，模型在分辨率≥0.7×0.7km²时表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 生成模型能够捕捉历史数据中的时空模式，未来研究将整合更多地球物理属性和驱动变量。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural

on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

Result: MDNS在多种统计特性的分布上表现出高效性和可扩展性，显著优于其他基于学习的方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: REFN是一种基于强化学习的框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成网络过滤器，以应对1天或N天漏洞利用的威胁，解决了现有防御措施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于设备部署规模庞大、补丁更新延迟以及现有防御措施的局限性（如兼容性和可扩展性问题），需要一种更高效的漏洞防御方法。

Method: REFN通过强化学习（RL）驱动的大型语言模型（LLMs）生成网络过滤器，结合在线网络奖励、边缘安全网关部署和实时网络流量验证，解决了LLMs在漏洞修复中的核心挑战。

Result: 在22类漏洞利用测试中，REFN表现出更高的准确性（比替代方案高21.1%）、更快的补丁时间（平均3.65小时）和更强的可扩展性（支持10K设备）。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLMs快速防御大规模漏洞利用提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电磁仿真中因计算复杂度高而难以生成足够训练数据的问题。

Method: 利用GPU加速开源电磁仿真软件（gprMax），生成大量天线仿真数据集，并比较不同机器学习模型的性能。

Result: 入门级GPU性能显著优于高端CPU，高端游戏GPU性能是高端CPU的18倍；开源软件在足够精细的分辨率下与商业软件结果相似。

Conclusion: GPU加速的开源框架为天线设计和优化提供了高效且经济的数据生成方案。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

Result: APFL在多种数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率提升1.10%-15.45%。

Conclusion: APFL通过双流设计解决了非独立同分布问题，具有异构不变性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

Motivation: 传统RLVR使用Pass@1作为奖励，导致策略偏向保守动作，陷入局部最优。Pass@k在评估中已有应用，但其与探索能力的关系尚未被充分研究。

Method: 采用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型（Pass@k Training），并通过理论分析推导其优势，设计高效的训练流程。

Result: Pass@k Training提升了模型的探索能力，探索与利用可以相互促进。优势函数设计展示了潜在的研究方向。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training为RLVR提供了一种有效方法，探索与利用的协同作用为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务提升模型能力，保留TargetDiff架构并通过L-BFGS优化步骤细化构象。

Result: 零样本对接成功率从53%提升至64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal/mol提升至-8.07 kcal/mol，QED提升25%，有效性和多样性达到最优。

Conclusion: IBEX通过信息瓶颈理论和优化步骤显著提升了药物设计中的生成模型性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Method: 提出DECAF-GAD框架，利用结构因果模型（SCM）解耦敏感属性，设计专用自动编码器结构和公平性损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DECAF-GAD在保持异常检测性能的同时显著提升公平性指标。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD有效解决了GAD中的公平性问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Motivation: 现实应用（如医疗和推荐系统）中的多臂老虎机问题通常具有非平稳动态特性，传统基于固定状态转移的算法难以适用。

Method: 提出RMAB算法，结合滑动窗口强化学习和UCB机制，学习动态转移及其变化。

Result: 算法实现了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾上界。

Conclusion: RMAB为非平稳多臂老虎机问题提供了首个理论框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Conclusion: 该工作为在线GP算法的数据点缩减标准选择提供了理论和实践指导。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为\ourdataset的数据集，用于解决AI驱动药物设计中缺乏实验先验知识的问题，通过LLM管道构建，并在多个任务中展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计缺乏实验先验知识，可能导致设计的分子违反隐含约束（如高突变性）。

Method: 构建了一个包含3230万对自然语言事实和实体表示的数据集\ourdataset，并使用LLM、CLIP和LLava架构进行联合推理训练。

Result: 在TDC任务中，使用\ourdataset预训练的模型表现优于更大的模型（如2B TxGemma），并在GuacaMol中生成更安全的分子。

Conclusion: \ourdataset为药物设计提供了有效的先验知识，显著提升了模型性能，并有望随着文献增长进一步扩展。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.
