A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and\ncontextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual\nInstruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced\nMulti-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,\noutperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5\n(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the\nefficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIMR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe91.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCIMR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728MAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCIMR\u4ee591.5%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4V\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "CIMR\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

We propose an alternate\navatar rendering scheme for broader social MR -- synthesizing realistic avatars\nthat preserve a user's demographic identity while being distinct enough from\nthe individual user to protect facial biometric information. We introduce a\nmethodology for privatizing appearance by isolating identity within the feature\nspace of identity-encoding generative models. We develop two algorithms that\nthen obfuscate identity: \\epsmethod{} provides differential privacy guarantees\nand \\thetamethod{} provides fine-grained control for the level of identity\noffset. These methods are shown to successfully generate de-identified virtual\navatars across multiple generative architectures in 2D and 3D. With these\ntechniques, it is possible to protect user privacy while largely preserving\nattributes related to sense of self. Employing these techniques in public\nsettings could enable the use of photorealistic avatars broadly in MR,\nmaintaining high realism and immersion without privacy risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u4f46\u6a21\u7cca\u4e2a\u4eba\u9762\u90e8\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5171\u4eab\u771f\u5b9e\u5916\u8c8c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5982\u7f51\u7edc\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8eab\u4efd\u7f16\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u8eab\u4efd\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u57282D\u548c3D\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u516c\u5171\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6c89\u6d78\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities.

We introduce two novel hybrid\nactivation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4\n(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for\npositive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a\nsteepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary\nclassification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three\ndifferent neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance\ncompared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on\nMNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.\nThe function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable\ngradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's\ngradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep\nnetworks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing\nfunctions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism.

Ensuring\nsafe and comfortable transitions is critical for reducing driving risks and\nimproving user experience.

Standard RL algorithms\ntypically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that\nthe current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for\nsystem evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is\ninvalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks\ninadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL\nalgorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that\ndo not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments\nwith complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by\ndynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which\nfurther complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we\npropose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial\ndynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,\nrespectively, to enhance routing decisions.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema.

This addresses a\nkey limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data\nscaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across\ncompute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically\nanalyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling\ncurves can be estimated for different data sources.

We show that this\nweighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,\nand we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly\nunchanged.

VRISE features interactive\nexperiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and\nwaypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive\ninterfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles.\nEvaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in\nmeasurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear\nprogression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying\nmodalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks\nrequiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the\npotential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying\neducation, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe\nand engaging setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86VRISE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6559\u5b66\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u5b58\u5728\u540e\u52e4\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5b66\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86VRISE\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5730\u9762\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u754c\u9762\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aVRISE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "conclusion": "VRISE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u73af\u5883\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the\noptimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights.

However, unaligned samples across different parties in\nVFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature\nrepresentation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,\nclass-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and\ninter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and\nfeature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual\nprototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn\nrelationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to\npredict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype\nlearning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal\ntransport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided\nmodule guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior\nprobabilities. Finally, we adopt an \\textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation\nstrategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically\nweighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved\nthat Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a\nconvergence rate of 1/\\sqrt T.

Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells\nbind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.\nThese processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the\nintracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling\ncomponents into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell\nphenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on\nlibraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial\nspace defined by such libraries.

Total: 23 pages 3 Figures", "summary": "Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are\ngaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in\nquantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models\n(\\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such\nas those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,\nsuch as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a\nfundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable\nmodels on real-world datasets. \\textit{In this paper, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined\nthrough \\textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those\nused for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,\ndesigning such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined\nquantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation\nstep. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum\ninformation projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map\nprovides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we\nintroduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an\niterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence\nlower bound.

This leads to agents that are brittle and fail\nto generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason\ncoherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that\nintegrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding\nverifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors.

Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative\nreinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,\nfreely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by\nhaving access to a \"simulator\". By employing known classical and new quantum\nalgorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within\nour learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms\nfrom RL like \"optimism in the face of uncertainty\" and \"posterior sampling\" and\ninstead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret\nbounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum\nalgorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number\nof time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier.

For\ninfinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors.
