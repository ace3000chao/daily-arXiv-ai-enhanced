Current mobile\nsensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine\nlearning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to\nmodel student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each\nLLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by\nsmartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict\nindividual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological\nmomentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality\nquestionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting\ntechniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management\nstrategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily\nactivities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This\nallows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original\ndataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the\nimpact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by\nmanipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using\nquestionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral\nchanges that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates\nhypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their\nmental health. This study showcases the power of LLM-driven behavioral modeling\nwith sensing data, opening new avenues for understanding and supporting student\nmental health."}

To address this, we\npropose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that\nexternalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,\nthe coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code\ngeneration.

Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations.

The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer.

To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal\nReasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense\nreasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference\nmechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,\ngenerating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework\nintegrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking\ndown problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for\ncontextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating\nlogical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative\nRefinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths.

While\npowerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,\nthey not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also\nsteerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and\nprecise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ\noptimization (CLIO).

Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same\ngender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias\nand female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological\nground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with\nmodel size.

However, existing\ncomputational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not\ndepressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the\nstandard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both\nclinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce\nReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each\nexhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the\nnine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a\nconcise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an\nexploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and\nemotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media\nnarratives.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence\npages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.\nOur comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4\nMLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text\nand visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building\nstronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the\nover-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to\nprovide answer even without evidence support.

Such representations tend to\nobscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with\ninternal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory\nepistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief\nstrength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states\nthan existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches."}

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with\ncomputational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging\nscaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot\ncontrol, autonomous driving and LLM training."}

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable.

We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models.

The first network (classification model) predicts the\nnumber of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then\npredicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN\narchitectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to\nminimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong\npredictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of\ndifferent compositions. The code developed is freely provided."}

Directly applying\nexisting CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to\nthree key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders\noverlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,\nresulting in suboptimal representations.

(3) The\nprimary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the\nability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive\nrepresentation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its\nco-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,\nwe introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework\nwith semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised\nlearning on TAHGs.

We compare\ndirectly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix\ntuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT\ntechniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the\nnumber of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models\nend-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of\ntotal parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot\nperformance of the base pretrained a policy."}

However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models.

In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs.

The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer.

Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with\nagent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves\ncomplete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless\nintegration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using\nframeworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from\nscratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as\nMarkov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a\nhierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment\nmodule, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into\ntraining transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such\nas multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we\nintroduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent\nobservability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent\nfinetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous\nimprovements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent\ntraining and deployment."}

While HCI research has proposed various AI role typologies, it\noften overlooks how AI reshapes users' roles as knowledge contributors. This\nstudy examines how users form epistemic relationships with AI-how they assess,\ntrust, and collaborate with it in research and teaching contexts. Based on 31\ninterviews with academics across disciplines, we developed a five-part codebook\nand identified five relationship types: Instrumental Reliance, Contingent\nDelegation, Co-agency Collaboration, Authority Displacement, and Epistemic\nAbstention. These reflect variations in trust, assessment modes, tasks, and\nhuman epistemic status. Our findings show that epistemic roles are dynamic and\ncontext-dependent. We argue for shifting beyond static metaphors of AI toward a\nmore nuanced framework that captures how humans and AI co-construct knowledge,\nenriching HCI's understanding of the relational and normative dimensions of AI\nuse."}

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language\nmodel can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying\nthe topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its\nown questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests\nwhich are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework\non three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the\nOMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually\ngenerating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language\nmodels can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated\ntraining datasets."}

Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.
