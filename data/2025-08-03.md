TL;DR: 论文研究了在在线房产预订平台中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）提升数据一致性的效果，比较了Mistral 7B和Mixtral 8x7B的性能与成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决第三方数据源的不完整和不一致问题，提升用户体验并减少市场流失。

Method: 在CALEIDOHOTELS平台上集成并评估了Mistral 7B（QLoRA微调）和Mixtral 8x7B（优化系统提示），比较其生成一致描述的能力。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6%）、精确度（98.8%）和幻觉率（1.2%）上优于Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高（50GB VRAM和$1.61/小时）。

Conclusion: 研究为生产环境中LLM的部署提供了质量与资源效率的权衡指导，证明了LLM在提升数据一致性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

### [2] [ElectriQ: A Benchmark for Assessing the Response Capability of Large Language Models in Power Marketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22911)
*Jinzhi Wang,Qingke Peng,Haozhou Li,Zeyuan Zeng,Qinfeng Song,Kaixuan Yang,Jiangbo Zhang,Yaoying Wang,Ruimeng Li,Biyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ElectriQ基准，用于评估和提升大型语言模型在电力营销场景中的表现，通过专业数据集和知识增强方法，发现小模型经过优化后可超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力营销客服系统（如中国95598热线）响应慢、流程僵化且专业任务准确性不足，通用大语言模型缺乏领域专业性和同理心。

Method: 提出ElectriQ基准，包含六类服务对话数据集和四项评估指标，结合领域知识库和知识增强方法优化模型。

Result: 实验显示，优化后的小模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性上超越GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为电力营销服务定制LLM提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合微调语言模型和半监督集成学习的层次分类框架，用于检测和分类非法市场内容，在多平台上表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法市场转向隐蔽网络，现有方法因数据有限、语言变化和平台异构性而难以检测。

Method: 采用ModernBERT提取语义表示，结合手工特征，通过两阶段分类（检测销售文档和进一步分类）。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率0.96489，F1分数0.93467，TMCC 0.95388。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限监督下具有强泛化能力和鲁棒性，适用于实际非法内容检测。

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

### [4] [A Hybrid Framework for Subject Analysis: Integrating Embedding-Based Regression Models with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22913)
*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合嵌入式机器学习模型与大语言模型的混合框架，用于更准确地预测图书馆主题词。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在多标签分类任务中难以处理未见过的案例，而大语言模型（LLMs）虽然强大但容易过度生成和产生幻觉。因此，需要一种更可靠的方法来改进主题分析。

Method: 通过结合嵌入式机器学习模型和LLMs，利用ML模型预测最优主题词数量并指导LLM生成，同时通过后编辑减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，混合框架能生成更受控且与词汇表对齐的主题词预测。

Conclusion: 混合框架在主题分析任务中表现优于单独使用LLMs或传统ML模型。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [5] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的知识图谱集成方法，通过标签匹配和三重匹配解决上下文匹配问题，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱集成方法在上下文匹配方面研究不足，尤其是在处理多样化和复杂上下文时表现不佳。

Method: 结合字符串操作、模糊匹配和向量相似度技术进行标签匹配，并通过三重匹配提升实体匹配准确性。

Result: 在OAEI竞赛中表现优异，优于监督方法，并在多样测试案例中实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了知识图谱集成中的上下文匹配问题，为未来研究提供了新数据集。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉现象进行了系统研究，包括定义、理论分析、检测与缓解策略，并提出了统一的检测与缓解流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs生成内容不忠实于输入或事实的问题，为幻觉现象提供理论基础和实践指南。

Method: 区分内在与外在幻觉，定义幻觉风险，并利用学习理论框架（PAC-Bayes和Rademacher复杂度）推导风险界限。提出检测策略（如不确定性估计、置信度校准）和缓解方法（如检索增强生成、微调）。

Result: 提出了统一的检测与缓解流程，并推荐了评估幻觉的数据集、指标和实验设置。

Conclusion: 本文为LLMs中的幻觉问题奠定了理论基础，并提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [7] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，通过引入时间逻辑解决传统RAG在处理时间相关查询时的不足，并在新基准测试中显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在处理需要跨时间追踪实体的查询时表现不佳，缺乏时间连贯性。

Method: 提出新框架，将查询分解为核心主题和时间窗口，使用专门检索器结合语义匹配和时间相关性。

Result: 在新基准ADQAB上，答案准确性比标准RAG提升13%至27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统提供了处理复杂时间相关问题的有效途径，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了Gemma-2语言模型中特征的普遍性，发现不同规模的模型在内部概念上仍具有可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究模型规模差异是否影响其内部概念的相似性，为跨模型可解释性提供基础。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）和激活相关性对齐特征，并通过SVCCA和RSA比较特征空间。

Result: 中间层特征重叠最强，早期和晚期层相似性较低；多令牌子空间分析显示语义相似子空间与模型交互方式相似。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在不同规模下仍能生成相似且可解释的特征，支持特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [9] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种模型预测临床试验中的严重不良事件（SAE）结果，利用预训练语言模型和滑动窗口方法，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，优化临床试验设计，减少试验终止和参与者风险。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）提取特征，结合分类器和回归模型预测SAE结果；开发滑动窗口方法处理长文本。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在预测SAE比例时AUC达77.6%，RMSE为18.6%；滑动窗口方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 临床试验注册数据未被充分利用，预测SAE结果有助于改进试验设计和发现预期与实际结果的差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

Method: 提出结构化分类法，分析8种VQ变体的算法原理、训练动态及与LLM的集成挑战，并讨论其在经典应用、单模态和多模态LLM系统中的表现。

Result: 总结了VQ技术对LLM性能的影响，识别了代码本崩溃、梯度估计不稳定和模态特定编码约束等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为高效且通用的多模态系统开发提供了基础参考，并指出了动态量化、统一标记化框架和生物启发式代码本学习等新兴研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A
continuously updated version is available at:

*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为语言模型链（LMC）的算法，通过多阶段级联的语言模型组合，显著提高了信息提取的速度和准确性，同时减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在文本处理中成本高、易产生幻觉信息的问题，避免资源浪费。

Method: 提出LMC算法，通过验证语言模型响应是否存在于候选答案中，并将错误响应输入更慢但更准确的模型，直至所有预测正确。

Result: 在医疗文档中提取患者出生日期的实验中，LMC显著提高了预测速度和准确性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: LMC算法对知识提取领域有重要贡献，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨社交媒体情绪是否对股票价格有预测作用，发现情绪与股价相关性较弱，而评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零售投资者在社交媒体上的活跃行为（如2021年GameStop事件）引发了对在线情绪是否影响股价的疑问。

Method: 使用三种情绪分析方法（包括基于ChatGPT和RoBERTa的新模型）分析Reddit的讨论，并通过相关性和因果性指标评估预测能力。

Result: 社交媒体情绪与股价相关性较弱，评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。

Conclusion: 传统情绪分析可能无法完全捕捉在线讨论对市场的影响，零售投资者行为复杂。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上有所进步，但其在不同语言和任务中的表现差异显著。研究旨在明确不同提示翻译策略对多语言系统性能的影响。

Method: 系统评估了在RAG增强的LLMs中，预翻译和跨语言提示等策略对多语言分类任务的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的提示策略能显著改善跨语言知识共享，从而提升下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究提倡更广泛地利用多语言资源共享和跨语言提示优化，尤其是针对低资源语言。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着美国计算机硕士项目中非本土学生比例增加（2023年达60.2%），研究其在英语环境下的同伴反馈体验差异。

Method: 使用Twitter-roBERTa模型分析500名学生的同伴反馈情感，结合语言背景、性别和年龄进行统计。

Result: 母语者对反馈评分较低，非母语者反馈更积极但收到的反馈较少；语言背景与性别、年龄交互作用显著。

Conclusion: 语言背景对同伴反馈体验有复杂但适度的影响，需在教学中关注。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Motivation: 现有记忆存储和检索方法在结构化组织和高效检索方面存在不足。

Method: 采用分层记忆架构，通过位置索引编码和索引路由机制实现高效检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务中，H-MEM优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: H-MEM在长期对话场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的输入嵌入方法，用于文档级关系抽取，通过全局上下文建模和多句子推理提升关系预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注实体出现的句子，无法捕捉完整文档上下文，导致关系抽取不准确。

Method: 引入一种新的输入嵌入方法，将实体表示为独立片段，利用全局关系和多句子推理。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL三个基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均具有意义，提升了关系检测性能，适用于需要全面实体级洞察的NLP应用。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark的多层次细粒度基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的能力，重点关注文档利用的多个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注RAG系统的整体性能，而缺乏对LLM特定能力的系统性评估，尤其是在文档利用方面的细粒度分析。

Method: 通过引入一个基于占位符的创新方法，分离LLM的参数化知识和外部知识的贡献，并设计了一个多层次的基准测试框架，包括多级过滤能力、组合能力和参考推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，代表性LLM在RAG系统中的生成能力存在局限性，尤其是在错误恢复和上下文忠实度方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统提供了可复现的框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，首次从特征层面验证了链式思考（CoT）提示在大型语言模型中的真实性，发现其在较大模型中能显著提升推理效果和模块化计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨链式思考（CoT）提示生成的“思考”是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，提取Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B模型在处理数学问题时的单义特征，对比CoT和无CoT提示的效果。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，CoT显著提升答案概率和激活稀疏性，而在70M模型中效果不明显；CoT还提高了特征可解释性和模块化计算。

Conclusion: CoT在高容量模型中能诱导更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark是一个用于评估医学大语言模型（MLLMs）幻觉问题的新型眼科基准，通过多阶段框架显著减少幻觉，提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，影响准确性，现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计三阶段框架（知识检索、任务案例研究、结果验证）来缓解幻觉。

Result: 实验表明该框架显著减少幻觉，提升准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs的幻觉问题提供了有效解决方案，推动了眼科诊断的进步。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成合成PII数据的方法，以促进隐私风险研究，并发布了数据集和代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PII泄露文本检测缺乏开源标注数据集，阻碍了可重复研究。

Method: 开发了生成合成PII数据的方法，利用LLMs生成类似Reddit帖子的多文本跨度数据集。

Result: 合成数据集在可重复性、不可链接性和不可区分性方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为在线社交媒体的PII隐私风险研究提供了可重复的数据支持。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

TL;DR: ACC-RAG动态调整压缩率以优化检索增强生成的推理效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩率方法无法适应查询复杂度，导致效率或准确性损失。

Method: 结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，动态调整压缩率。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于固定压缩率方法，推理速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: 神经符号系统是提升视觉语言理解的可行方向，未来研究可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架显著提升了AIOps任务的准确性和效率，为多模型协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

### [31] [Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940)
*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE是一个新框架，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理过程中存在的事实性错误问题，通过事实检查、强化学习和可解释性模块提升模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理步骤中常出现事实性错误，尽管最终答案正确，这在医疗、法律等高风险领域可能引发严重后果。

Method: RELIANCE整合了事实检查分类器、GRPO强化学习方法和可解释性模块，以提升推理的事实性和结构正确性。

Result: 实验显示，RELIANCE显著提高了事实准确性（最高提升49.90%），并在多个基准测试中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: RELIANCE为未来通过激活引导优化提升事实性提供了基础，并揭示了模型推理轨迹的改进机制。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SigBERT是一种创新的时序生存分析框架，通过处理电子医疗报告中的文本数据，结合签名提取和LASSO惩罚的Cox模型，显著提升了生存分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生存分析方法难以有效处理文本数据的复杂性，尤其是时序形式的文本数据。

Method: SigBERT通过提取和平均词嵌入生成句子嵌入，利用粗糙路径理论中的签名提取捕获时序动态，并将这些特征整合到LASSO惩罚的Cox模型中。

Result: 在真实世界的肿瘤数据集上，SigBERT在独立测试队列中获得了0.75的C-index分数（标准差0.014）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序医疗数据，提升了风险估计的准确性，推动了基于叙事的生存分析的发展。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自然语言处理（NLP）和多波自适应采样方法加速验证研究的方法，显著减少了人工审核时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高大型索赔数据库中算法验证的效率，减少人工审核的时间和资源消耗。

Method: 使用NLP减少人工审核时间，结合多波自适应采样方法，通过预定义标准提前终止验证研究。

Result: NLP辅助审核使每份图表审核时间减少40%，多波采样方法避免了77%的图表审核，且不影响测量精度。

Conclusion: 该方法可促进更频繁的算法验证，增强数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

### [34] [Opacity as Authority: Arbitrariness and the Preclusion of Contestation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22944)
*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新定义任意性，将其视为人类系统和互动的基础功能机制，而非规范性缺陷或支配症状。通过扩展索绪尔的符号任意性概念，提出任意性在语言、法律和社会动态中的跨领域应用，并引入“动机→可观察性→可争议性”链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统批判理论将任意性与不公正混为一谈，本文旨在揭示任意性作为符号特性的功能，证明其在多领域中的有效性。

Method: 基于索绪尔的符号任意性理论，提出“动机→可观察性→可争议性”链，并结合香农的熵模型，形式化任意性为A=H(L|M)。

Result: 任意性通过“无动机化”或“冲突侧化”机制，保护权威免受问责，同时为控制和关怀提供中性操作符。

Conclusion: 任意性不仅是社会系统的核心机制，还为人工智能系统的可解释性分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于评估口语对话模型（SDMs）的基准数据集，包含1079个实例，并采用基于LLM的评估方法，以解决SDMs在理解和模拟人类对话中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SDMs在实际对话中的有效性，填补与文本大语言模型（LLMs）相比的研究空白，尤其是针对口语对话的复杂性和模糊性问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含1079个实例的基准数据集（英语和中文），并开发了一种基于LLM的评估方法，以模拟人类判断。

Result: 数据集和评估方法为SDMs的性能提供了全面的分析工具，揭示了其在处理口语对话复杂性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为SDMs的发展提供了重要基准，有助于推动其在理解和模拟人类对话方面的进步。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了当代LLMs在数学文本自然语言推理（Math NLI）任务中的表现，构建了一个由人类专家标注的数据集，并比较了LLMs生成假设的效果。研究发现LLMs在某些情况下表现接近人类，但仍存在数学语言理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当代LLMs在数学文本NLI任务中的能力，填补Math NLI领域的研究空白，并为未来研究提供数据支持。

Method: 构建由人类标注的Math NLI数据集，比较LLMs生成假设的效果，分析LLMs的性能和一致性。

Result: LLMs在部分场景下表现接近人类，但在数学语言理解上仍有不足，偶尔连基本推理也会失败。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI任务中有潜力，但需进一步提升数学语言理解能力。数据集为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的上下文学习（ICL）进行框架语义解析（FSP），无需微调模型。通过自动生成任务特定提示，在FrameNet数据库上实现了竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需微调模型的方法，利用ICL和LLMs完成FSP任务，减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 自动生成任务特定提示（基于FrameNet数据库的定义和标注示例），用于指导六种不同的LLMs，完成框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL）。

Result: 在暴力事件相关帧的子集上，FI的F1得分为94.3%，FSRL为77.4%。

Conclusion: ICL为领域特定FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

TL;DR: CARoPE是一种动态生成位置编码的新方法，优于传统的RoPE，提高了模型的表达能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE虽然高效，但其静态频率模式限制了上下文敏感关系的建模能力。

Method: CARoPE通过动态生成与token嵌入相关的频率模式，引入上下文敏感的位置表示。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE显著降低了困惑度，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了一种可扩展、表达力强且高效的位置编码方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

Motivation: 解决现有模型在编辑时缺乏全局一致性的问题，提出一种能跨领域保持语义和视觉一致性的编辑框架。

Method: 采用Reward-Refine（推理时奖励引导细化）和RewardDPO（训练时奖励对齐布局对优化）两种策略。

Result: 在SMARTEdit-Bench上表现优于InstructPix2Pix和HIVE，RewardDPO在结构化场景提升15%，Reward-Refine在自然图像上表现更优。

Conclusion: 奖励引导的规划能有效生成语义一致且视觉对齐的编辑结果，自动和人工评估均验证了其价值。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的自然语言数据库接口在扩展到企业级数据目录时存在挑战，且未能充分利用数据库元数据中的语义信息。

Method: 通过将数据库模式和元数据分解为离散的语义单元，并分别索引以实现针对性检索，同时控制检索表的数量在可管理范围内。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高召回率和准确性的同时，优于基线方法，适用于结构和元数据多样的大规模数据库。

Conclusion: 该解决方案填补了自然语言数据库接口在可扩展性方面的关键空白，适用于多样化的企业环境。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在文本歧义处理中的可信度问题，特别是中文文本歧义。

Method: 创建包含歧义句子及其消歧对的基准数据集，分类为3大类9子类，通过实验评估LLMs表现。

Result: LLMs无法可靠区分歧义文本，对歧义文本表现出过度自信和过度思考。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在歧义处理上存在根本性局限，需改进语言理解中的不确定性处理方法。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态间的因果关系是现实环境中多模态模型的核心挑战。

Method: 通过图像和文本片段的任务步骤对比，评估模型是否能推断视觉观察与文本步骤的因果依赖关系。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型表现不佳（最佳F1为0.57），思维链推理略有提升（F1至0.62），远低于人类（F1为0.98）。

Conclusion: 研究为提升多模态模型的因果理解能力指明了具体方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Motivation: 探讨如何在不直接打扰用户的情况下，通过用户与语言模型的交互日志获取反馈，以持续优化模型。

Method: 分析两个用户-LM交互数据集（WildChat和LMSYS），研究隐式用户反馈的内容和极性，并评估其对模型性能的影响。

Result: 用户反馈的内容（如需要澄清）能提升模型在简短问题（MTBench）上的表现，但对复杂问题（WildBench）无效；反馈的有用性与用户初始提示的质量密切相关。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈具有潜力，但其效果受限于反馈内容和用户初始提示的质量。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

Motivation: 现有集成方法忽略模型在不同上下文中的置信度和可靠性差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: LENS通过分析层间隐藏状态和归一化概率，训练轻量级线性置信预测器，动态调整模型权重。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务中，LENS显著优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为模型置信度提供了有效信号，可用于提升集成学习性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化低层内核开发以满足性能和生产力需求变得至关重要。

Method: GEAK采用推理时计算缩放和Reflexion式反馈机制生成Triton代码。

Result: GEAK在正确性上提升63%，执行速度提升2.59倍。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了代理式代码生成在加速硬件平台采用和普及专家级内核性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用负样本优化正样本选择的方法，以提升少样本上下文学习（ICL）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注正样本的使用，忽视了负样本中的额外信息。本文旨在通过负样本优化正样本选择，提升ICL性能。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本库，在推理时通过语义相似性选择正负样本，并进一步从正样本库中检索与负样本相似的正样本，作为ICL演示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖最相似正样本的方法，验证了负样本信息对提升ICL性能的作用。

Conclusion: 负样本中的信息有助于优化正样本选择，从而提升少样本上下文学习的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

TL;DR: MTMs是一种基于稀疏自编码器学习的可解释特征的主题模型，能够揭示更深层次的概念主题，并支持基于主题的文本生成控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征；神经变体虽使用更丰富的表示，但仍受限于词列表表达主题。

Method: MTMs利用稀疏自编码器学习的可解释特征定义主题，并通过主题导向向量实现可控文本生成。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统和神经基线相当或更优，且更受主题评价框架偏好。

Conclusion: MTMs通过语义丰富的特征空间和可控生成能力，为复杂主题建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期准确诊断需要分析多种异构生物标志物，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在结构化生物医学数据预测中具有潜力。

Method: TAP-GPT通过上下文学习构建少量样本的表格提示，并使用参数高效的qLoRA适配对TableGPT2进行微调，用于AD与认知正常（CN）的二元分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT利用TableGPT2的表格理解能力和LLMs的先验知识，性能优于通用LLM和表格基础模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLMs应用于表格生物标志物数据预测任务，为未来生物医学信息学中的多智能体框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Motivation: 心理健康领域的个性化聊天机器人发展迅速，但其解释性和对话推理能力尚未充分研究，因此探索LLMs在该领域的语用推理能力。

Method: 提出P-ReMe数据集，重新定义隐含意义和预设现象，并设计相关任务。评估了四种LLMs模型（Llama3.1、Mistral、MentaLLaMa、Qwen）。此外，提出StiPRompts研究污名问题，评估了GPT-4o mini、Deepseek-chat和Claude-3.5-haiku。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康领域的语用推理能力具有潜力，但需进一步优化。Claude-3.5-haiku在污名问题上的表现值得关注。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Method: 系统评估了10个开源大语言模型在8个翻译数据集上的表现，并进行错误分析。

Result: 发现孟加拉语性能普遍低于英语，分词效率与模型准确性呈反比关系。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进数据集质量和多语言评估方法的必要性，推动了针对低资源语言的NLP研究。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE模型中专家的重要性差异，揭示关键子集（SEs）的作用及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析SEs的激活异常、分布特性及修剪实验，评估其对模型性能和注意力机制的影响。

Result: SEs具有稀有但极端的激活异常，修剪SEs会显著降低模型性能，并破坏注意力分布。

Conclusion: SEs在MoE模型中扮演关键角色，其压缩需谨慎，研究为MoE模型优化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Method: 通过实验分析GPT-4o-mini在改写敏感内容时的隐式净化行为，并评估其零样本分类敏感句子的能力。

Result: GPT-4o-mini能系统性地将内容净化至较低敏感级别，显著减少贬义和禁忌语言；在零样本分类任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM具备隐式净化能力，且零样本分类敏感内容的效果显著，为内容审核提供了新思路。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

Motivation: LLM在音乐领域表现受限，因训练数据中音乐知识较少。

Method: 结合音乐专用向量数据库MusWikiDB，并在推理和微调阶段利用上下文信息。

Result: MusT-RAG显著优于传统微调方法，在内外域音乐问答任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG和MusWikiDB有效提升了LLM在音乐领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Conclusion: TeQoDO为提升LLM解释性提供了可行方案，并展示了对话理论的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

Motivation: 当前基准无法直接评估多模态现实世界规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束。

Method: 引入MPCC基准，包含三个现实任务（飞行、日历、会议规划）和复杂约束（预算、时间、空间），并设置难度等级。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅21.3%生成可行计划，开源模型低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供了严格评估框架，突显了约束感知推理在现实应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到最先进性能，序列长度减少85%，推理时间减少82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在不改变LLM架构的情况下显著提升了嵌入任务性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum通过多关系图和结构熵最小化，有效解决了多文档摘要的挑战，生成高质量摘要。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语因其复杂的形态、可选变音符号以及现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与多种方言的共存，对自然语言处理（NLP）和信息检索（IR）提出了独特挑战。尽管阿拉伯语全球重要性日益增长，但在NLP研究和基准资源中仍未被充分代表。

Method: 提出了一种增强型密集段落检索（DPR）框架，核心是一种新颖的注意力相关评分（ARS），取代了标准交互机制，采用自适应评分函数更有效地建模问题与段落之间的语义相关性。方法结合了预训练的阿拉伯语语言模型和架构优化。

Result: 该方法显著提升了阿拉伯语问答的检索性能和排名准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架为阿拉伯语NLP任务提供了有效的解决方案，代码已公开在GitHub上。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动批判性思维范式，要求AI模型主动寻求缺失或澄清信息以解决用户查询，并基于GSM8K构建了两个新基准（GSM-MC和GSM-MCE）进行评估。实验表明，现有模型在此任务上表现不佳，但通过强化学习可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统主要采用被动批判性思维，仅拒绝问题查询而未主动解决用户需求。本文旨在推动模型通过主动批判性思维更有效地与用户协作解决问题。

Method: 提出主动批判性思维范式，并设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个基准测试数学推理能力。使用强化学习算法提升模型性能。

Result: 实验显示，现有模型在主动批判性思维任务上表现较差，但强化学习显著提升了Qwen3-1.7B在GSM-MC上的准确率（从0.15%到73.98%）。

Conclusion: 通过主动批判性思维和强化学习，AI模型能更有效地协作解决问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: 研究探讨如何通过微调大型语言模型（LLMs）生成基于用户角色的响应，并评估三种建模策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中，LLMs需根据用户角色控制行为，现有方法未解决角色特定访问限制。

Method: 采用BERT和LLM分类器及角色条件生成策略，构建两个数据集进行评估。

Result: 评估模型在不同组织结构和对抗性攻击下的性能。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在企业环境中的角色特定行为控制提供了可行方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 评估LLM在临床决策支持中的安全性和有效性，为其在医疗环境中的部署提供标准化指标。

Method: 基于专家共识开发CSEDB框架，包含30项标准，由32名专科医生开发2069个开放式问答项目，测试6个LLM的性能。

Result: LLM整体表现中等（平均总分57.2%），高风险场景性能下降13.3%。专业医学LLM在安全性和有效性上优于通用模型。

Conclusion: CSEDB为医学LLM的临床评估提供了标准化工具，有助于识别风险和改进方向，促进LLM在医疗中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学领域中检索与推理的联合优化不足，且过度依赖监督微调，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Med-R³框架，先培养模型的逻辑推理能力，再优化检索能力，最后联合优化检索与推理的协调。

Result: 实验表明，Med-R³显著提升性能，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R³超越GPT-4o-mini 3.93%，Qwen2.5-14B + Med-R³提升13.53%。

Conclusion: Med-R³通过联合优化检索与推理，在医学领域实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

TL;DR: T-Detect是一种新型文本检测方法，通过使用重尾t分布替代高斯分布，显著提升了对对抗性文本的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本检测器依赖高斯分布假设，但对抗性文本具有重尾统计特征，导致检测效果不佳。

Method: T-Detect采用t分布的重尾差异分数，通过归一化对数似然与t分布期望矩计算检测分数。

Result: 在RAID和HART数据集上，T-Detect性能优于基线方法，AUROC提升达3.9%。

Conclusion: T-Detect为文本检测提供了新的理论基础，并在对抗条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Motivation: 改进Transformer模型的性能，通过差分注意力机制消除噪声，同时保持LoRA的高效性。

Method: 在正负注意力项上引入低秩适配器，结合差分注意力机制，形成DiffLoRA。

Result: 在大多数任务中表现不及其他方法，但在某些领域（如HumanEval）表现优于LoRA（+11分）。

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在特定任务中表现优异，但需进一步分析其注意力模式以优化性能。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Conclusion: 方法在仇恨言论检测和净化方面表现优异，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

Result: 生成的解释在正确性和清晰度上表现良好，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成逻辑规则解释方面具有潜力，但需进一步研究解决现有问题。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Motivation: QA基准测试是间接评估LLMs问题解决能力的方法，需要更直接且可推广的评估框架。

Method: 采用级联问题披露方法，分阶段揭示问题信息，以激发LLMs的广义推理能力。

Result: 该方法不仅改进了LLMs之间的比较，还生成了更好的中间推理痕迹，缩小了标准QA评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 研究表明，标准QA评估高估了模型间的性能差异，新框架提供了更准确的评估。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Motivation: 脑老化合成在临床和计算神经科学中具有广泛应用，但高维数据、年龄间结构的细微变化以及个体特异性模式是主要挑战。

Method: NeuroAR利用生成自回归变换器，通过自回归估计未来扫描的离散标记图，并结合先前的扫描和目标年龄信息进行引导生成。

Conclusion: NeuroAR能够高保真地模拟个体特异性脑老化轨迹，显著优于其他关键模型。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Conclusion: KANs在科学机器学习中展现出显著优势，但仍需解决计算效率、理论保证等问题，未来研究应关注其鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Result: 实验验证了框架在多种极端气候事件上的高预测准确性，BiLSTM表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究提升了多灾害预警系统的可解释性和实用性，支持农业气候风险管理决策。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Method: 提出FedCVD++框架，包括树子集采样、XGBoost特征提取和联邦SMOTE同步，以解决通信开销和类别不平衡。

Result: 在Framingham数据集上，FedCVD++的F1分数优于集中式方法，通信效率提升3.2倍。

Conclusion: FedCVD++首次将非参数模型成功集成到联邦医疗系统中，提供了隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

TL;DR: GSM-UTCI是一种多模态深度学习框架，用于预测城市尺度的超局部热应力，具有高精度和高效性，为城市气候适应提供决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着极端热事件加剧，城市需要高效且可扩展的工具来评估和缓解热应力，传统物理模型计算成本高，难以满足需求。

Method: 提出GSM-UTCI框架，融合地表形态、土地覆盖数据和气象条件，使用FiLM架构动态调整空间特征，基于SOLWEIG数据训练。

Result: 模型精度高（R2=0.9151，MAE=0.41°C），推理时间从小时级降至分钟级，应用于费城绿化场景显示显著降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是一种可扩展的精细决策工具，支持城市气候适应策略的评估。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Result: 指出人类测试用于AI评估缺乏理论和实证依据，呼吁开发新框架。

Conclusion: 应停止用人类测试评估AI，转而开发针对AI的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Motivation: 多模态模型在正向任务中表现出色，但其逆映射潜力尚未充分探索，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出基于优化的框架，在文本-图像和文本-音频模态中双向推断输入特征。

Result: 实验表明，优化虽能强制模型输出与目标对齐，但逆映射的感知质量混乱且语义不可解释。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间缺乏支持稳健逆映射的结构，需进一步研究开发语义丰富且可逆的潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Conclusion: KLLM通过硬件-软件协同设计，有效解决了量化中的精度和执行效率问题，显著提升了大型语言模型推理的性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Result: 发现一小部分但持续有影响的滞后，表明演员行为对流程性能有直接可测量的影响。

Conclusion: 演员中心的时间序列方法能更细致地理解个体行为如何影响整体流程效率。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Motivation: 万古霉素在ICU中用于严重革兰氏阳性感染，但肾毒性风险高，早期预测肾功能损伤具有挑战性。

Method: 分析了10,288名ICU患者数据，使用KDIGO标准定义肾损伤，通过特征选择和多种算法（如CatBoost）开发预测模型。

Result: CatBoost表现最佳（AUROC 0.818），关键预测因子包括磷酸盐、总胆红素等，SHAP和ALE分析验证了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确预测万古霉素相关肌酐升高，支持ICU中的早期风险检测和干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Conclusion: 该模型为断裂预测提供了一种统一、可扩展的解决方案，优于传统的模拟器专用工作流程。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: BiGG-E是一种高效且可扩展的模型，适用于加权图的生成任务。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between

investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness

of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC

### [88] [FuseTen: A Generative Model for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation from Spatio-Temporal Satellite Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23154)
*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FuseTen的生成框架，通过融合多源卫星数据生成高时空分辨率的每日地表温度（LST）数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市热浪、干旱和土地退化是气候变化背景下的紧迫问题，需要高精度的地表温度数据来研究这些现象。

Method: FuseTen结合Sentinel-2、Landsat 8和Terra MODIS数据，采用生成式架构和物理原理监督策略，融合时空观测数据。

Result: 实验表明，FuseTen在定量指标和视觉保真度上分别平均提升了32.06%和31.42%，优于线性基线方法。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个能够在10米空间分辨率下生成每日LST的非线性方法，为解决高时空分辨率数据需求提供了新途径。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计LLM服务时，需要同时优化推理时间预算、事实真实性和推理能力，但研究发现三者无法同时达到最优。

Conclusion: BAR定理为LLM应用设计提供了一个原则性框架，帮助在实践中平衡三者关系。

Abstract: When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties:
inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. However,
our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用NaN传播检测黑箱函数稀疏性的方法，解决了传统有限差分法因偶然零梯度导致的假阴性问题，显著提升了梯度计算的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分法在检测黑箱函数稀疏性时存在假阴性问题，可能导致梯度计算错误且难以诊断。

Method: 通过系统性地用NaN污染输入并观察输出是否变为NaN，重建保守的稀疏模式，消除假阴性。

Result: 在航空航天机翼重量模型中，实现了1.52倍的加速，并检测到传统方法遗漏的数十个依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该方法利用IEEE 754标准，无需修改现有黑箱代码即可跨语言和数学库工作，显著提升了稀疏性检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Motivation: 解决多模态文档结构不一致和训练数据不足的问题。

Method: 结合语义结构化模块、零样本多模态分析和分层检索系统。

Result: 查询延迟降低45%，在MMLongBench-Doc基准上准确率达64.7%。

Conclusion: DocsRay在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了多模态文档处理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决AI生成文本中上下文幻觉（不实内容）的问题，提升生成内容的可信度。

Method: 使用生成器无关的观察模型，通过单次前向传递和残差流上的线性探针检测幻觉，并分析梯度与激活以定位信号。

Result: 发现一个可转移的线性方向能有效区分幻觉与真实文本，且通过操纵该方向可因果控制幻觉率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了幻觉信号的低维内部表征及其与特定MLP子电路的关联，为检测和缓解幻觉提供了新途径，并发布了ContraTales基准数据集。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增量学习视角的高效机器遗忘算法（IAU），解决了传统基于影响的遗忘方法计算开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题日益突出，机器遗忘（让模型“忘记”特定训练数据）受到关注，但现有方法（如基于影响的遗忘）因计算Hessian矩阵及其逆矩阵而计算开销巨大，难以应用于大规模模型或频繁数据删除场景。

Method: 论文从认知科学中“记忆比遗忘更容易”的理论出发，建立了增量学习（记忆）与遗忘的理论联系，并基于此提出了高效的IAU算法。

Result: 实验表明，IAU在删除保证、遗忘效率和模型性能之间取得了优越的平衡，并在多种数据集和模型架构上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IAU通过增量学习视角解决了机器遗忘的计算效率问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSwarm是一个动态多智能体系统框架，通过强化学习和动态图选择优化协作结构，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统框架依赖静态协作图结构，限制了适应性和性能。

Method: 提出DynaSwarm框架，结合A2C强化学习机制和动态图选择器，通过参数高效微调优化图结构。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和编程任务中，DynaSwarm表现优于现有单智能体和多智能体基线。

Conclusion: 样本感知的结构灵活性对多智能体系统设计至关重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于知识推荐系统的查询-注释者配对策略，通过考虑注释者的情绪和疲劳水平等内部因素，减少标注错误并提高模型训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习中，现有策略未充分考虑注释者的内部因素（如情绪、疲劳）对标注质量的影响，导致标注错误和效率低下。

Method: 采用知识推荐系统（RS），结合注释者的历史准确率、情绪和疲劳水平，以及查询实例信息，选择最佳注释者。

Result: 实验表明，考虑内部因素显著减少了标注错误和模型训练的不确定性，同时提高了准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 本研究为探索人类认知因素对主动学习的影响提供了初步方法，验证了内部因素对标注质量的重要性。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Result: 发现样本的内在学习难度与其隐私风险之间存在强相关性，且最终模型中高脆弱性样本的隐私风险在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解隐私风险在训练中的动态出现提供了基础，支持开发主动的隐私感知模型训练策略。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers提供了一种高效、正确且易于使用的方法来构建生产级序列模型，已在JAX和TensorFlow 2中实现。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励反馈，导致优化效率低下，因此需要更高效的奖励机制来加速LRMs的训练。

Method: 提出了一种基于内在信号的生成过程评估机制，将连续正确/错误的步骤聚合为连贯的‘思想’单元，并引入能力自适应奖励机制动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上实验表明，该方法比仅依赖结果奖励的基线方法显著提高了问题解决准确率，且训练样本更少。

Conclusion: 结构化过程奖励能显著加速LRMs在数学推理任务中的优化。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Patch robustness certification defends against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees. Existing techniques struggle with top-k predictions due to vote inflation and combinatorial explosion. CostCert, a new scalable and precise defender, avoids these issues by verifying the true label within top-k predictions without pairwise comparisons. It outperforms PatchGuard significantly in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing certified recovery techniques for adversarial patch attacks fail to precisely certify the true label within top-k predictions due to vote inflation and combinatorial explosion.

Method: CostCert verifies the true label within top-k predictions by checking if the attack budget is insufficient to exclude the true label, avoiding pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion.

Result: CostCert outperforms PatchGuard, retaining up to 57.3% certified accuracy with a patch size of 96, while PatchGuard drops to zero.

Conclusion: CostCert provides a scalable and precise solution for certified recovery in top-k predictions, significantly improving robustness against adversarial patch attacks.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Motivation: 共享单车系统中时空变化的用户需求导致库存不平衡，增加了重新分配成本，因此需要通过动态定价优化需求管理。

Method: 开发了一种可微分代理模拟方法，用于快速设计动态定价策略，考虑了用户多样性及其概率性选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在25个车站和5个时间段的场景中减少了73%-78%的损失，并实现了100倍以上的收敛速度提升；在大规模场景（289个车站）中，无需人工干预即可实现库存平衡。

Conclusion: 通过适当的初始条件设置，可以最小化诱导库存平衡的折扣成本，证明了该方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by

TL;DR: PLARE利用视觉语言模型（VLM）为离线强化学习提供指导信号，避免手动设计奖励函数，并在机器人任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习需要手动设计奖励函数，成本高且耗时，PLARE通过VLM自动生成偏好标签，解决了这一问题。

Method: PLARE通过查询VLM获取视觉轨迹段的偏好标签，使用监督对比偏好学习目标直接训练策略。

Result: 在MetaWorld任务中，PLARE性能达到或超过现有VLM奖励生成方法，并在真实机器人任务中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: PLARE提供了一种高效且实用的离线强化学习解决方案，无需手动设计奖励函数。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Conclusion: 蜂蜜矿物质元素能有效区分掺假蜂蜜，随机森林是最佳分类器。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared

Motivation: 解决传统方法在建模时间依赖偏微分方程时参数效率低和长程动态建模困难的问题。

Method: 提出时空状态空间神经算子（ST-SSM），通过分解时空维度并独立建模时间演化和空间交互。

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中表现优于其他方案，参数更少且性能竞争。

Conclusion: 时空分解的算子学习具有高效性和泛化性，为PDE建模提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Coflex在准确性和能效方面优于现有方法，计算速度提升1.9x至9.5x。

Conclusion: Coflex是一种高效且可扩展的HW-NAS解决方案，适用于边缘设备的深度神经网络加速器开发。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to

signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Motivation: 实践中决策者常忽略结构不确定性，研究旨在确定何时这种不确定性需要方法论解决。

Method: 采用贝叶斯模型平均方法，分析双变量关系（X→Y vs. X←Y），并验证其适用条件。

Result: 模拟显示现代因果发现方法可在一定范围内量化不确定性，方法在特定条件下最优。

Conclusion: 框架补充了现有稳健因果推断方法，解决了实践中常被忽视的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DEA的动态集成聚合方法，用于连续控制任务中的Q值估计，通过可学习的方向参数自适应调整保守性和探索性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态集成聚合方法（如取最小值）在连续控制任务中过于粗糙，无法适应任务需求或学习阶段的变化，导致信息丢失和性能受限。

Method: DEA通过两个可学习的方向参数（分别调节保守性和探索性）和基于Bellman误差的加权机制，动态调整Q值估计的聚合方式。

Result: 在多种连续控制基准和学习模式下，DEA表现优于静态集成策略。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的方式自适应调整聚合策略，提升了连续控制任务的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

Motivation: 探索验证时间与证书长度之间的基本关系，为复杂性理论中的问题提供新的分析视角。

Method: 提出并证明验证时间与证书长度的下界关系定理，应用于复杂性类分离和具体问题（如字符串周期性和旋转检测）。

Result: 证明验证时间减少需要更长的证书，并展示该定理在复杂性类分离和自然问题中的适用性。

Conclusion: 验证时间与证书长度之间存在权衡关系，为复杂性理论中的开放问题（如P vs. NP）提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高概率收敛分析要求剪裁阈值随优化步骤增加，与标准DP机制不兼容，因此需要研究固定剪裁阈值下的收敛性。

Method: 采用固定剪裁阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD方法，适用于重尾噪声（中心α阶矩有界假设，α∈(1,2]）下的凸和非凸平滑优化。

Result: 固定剪裁阈值下，方法收敛到最优解邻域，速度优于现有方法，且邻域大小可与DP噪声平衡。

Conclusion: 固定剪裁阈值的DP-Clipped-SGD在收敛速度和隐私保证之间提供了更优的权衡。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 持续学习（CL）中，灾难性遗忘是一个主要挑战。现有的经验回放方法因关键样本分布稀疏而效果有限，导致决策边界过于简化。

Method: 提出Experience Blending框架，包括两部分：1）多变量差分隐私（DP）噪声机制生成SBD；2）端到端训练策略，结合存储样本和SBD。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上，方法优于9个基线，准确率分别提升10%、6%和13%。

Conclusion: 通过引入SBD作为隐式正则化器，有效稳定决策边界并减少遗忘，显著提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Result: PEFT方法在深度可分离卷积架构中的内存效率仅为LLMs的一半，但在边缘优化的卷积架构中可减少95%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于硬件限制和性能需求选择PEFT方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is
online.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our

Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维数据中特征选择的挑战，尤其是捕捉特征间依赖关系，同时兼顾模型稀疏性、可解释性和性能。

Method: 将特征选择视为组合优化问题，利用模拟退火进行全局搜索，并以Fisher判别比作为模型质量的代理指标。

Result: 实验表明，SA-FDR能选择更紧凑的特征子集，同时保持高预测准确性，优于贪心优化方法。

Conclusion: SA-FDR为高维数据提供了一种灵活且高效的特征选择方案，特别适用于需要稀疏性、可解释性和性能的场景。

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

TL;DR: GraphRAG-R1通过强化学习增强多跳推理能力，解决了现有GraphRAG方法在复杂问题中的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法在多跳推理中存在局限性，未能充分利用LLM的推理潜力。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1显著提升了LLM在多跳推理中的能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCR方法需要用户指定组件数量，且在大规模数据或组件数量增加时面临可扩展性和可靠性问题。

Method: 将MCR重新定义为生成过程，使用能量基深度学习求解器EB-gMCR，通过可微分门控网络从候选池中筛选活跃组件并估计其浓度。

Result: 在噪声合成数据中，EB-gMCR保持R^2 >= 0.98，组件数量估计误差在5%以内；低噪声时R^2 >= 0.99，组件估计接近精确。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR结合高容量生成建模和硬组件选择，为大规模信号解混分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体分层策略学习提供了有效解决方案，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，L-GTA生成的增强数据更可靠、一致且可控，显著优于直接变换方法。

Conclusion: L-GTA为时间序列数据增强提供了一种高效且可控的新方法，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 通过RNN框架解释了softmax注意力的表达力，揭示了其优于线性注意力的原因。

Conclusion: softmax注意力的RNN形式揭示了其表达力的来源，为改进注意力机制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust和FedBN-P有效提升联邦学习的防御能力和收敛性能，适用于医疗数据场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Conclusion: 该技术提供了一种新颖的、以可解释性驱动的正则化方法，使机器学习模型更准确可靠。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展且资源高效的缓存解决方案，适用于高流量LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Conclusion: FPMD通过单步采样显著提升了扩散策略的推理效率，为在线强化学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Result: 在TCGA数据集上，DepMicroDiff的Pearson相关系数达0.712，余弦相似度达0.812，RMSE和MAE更低。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff在微生物组数据插补中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

Motivation: 传统模型选择需要大量标注验证数据，成本高且耗时。

Result: 在26个基准任务上，CODA比现有方法减少70%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: CODA为高效模型选择提供了一种低成本解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Result: 人类参与的对话提升了准确性，而纯AI对话因知识相似性导致准确性下降。知识多样性是协同改进的关键。

Conclusion: AI开发应注重代理间的知识多样性，而非仅优化个体性能，以提升群体协作效果。

Abstract: Conversations transform individual knowledge into collective insight,
allowing groups of humans and increasingly groups of artificial intelligence
(AI) agents to collaboratively solve complex problems. Whether interactions
between AI agents can replicate the synergy observed in human discussions
remains an open question. To investigate this, we systematically compared four
conversational configurations: pairs of large language models (LLM-LLM), trios
of LLMs, trios of humans, and mixed human-LLM pairs. After agents answered
questions individually, they engaged in open-ended discussions and then
reconsidered their initial answers. Interactions involving humans consistently
led to accuracy improvements after the conversations, benefiting both stronger
and weaker participants. By contrast, purely LLM-based pairs and trios
exhibited declines in accuracy, demonstrating limited conversational synergy.
Analysis of participants' confidence and answer-switching behavior revealed
that knowledge diversity is a critical factor enabling collaborative
improvement. Crucially, the lack of gains in LLM-LLM interactions did not stem
from a fundamental limitation of the models' ability to collaborate, but from
highly similar knowledge states that left little room for productive exchange.
Our findings argue for a paradigm shift in AI development: rather than
optimizing individual models solely for standalone performance, explicitly
cultivating diversity across agents, even at the cost of slightly lower
individual accuracy, may yield AI collaborators that are more effective in
group settings with humans or other AI systems.

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex

many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于能源转型和能源价格上涨，法国集体自用电操作增加，但现有监控依赖历史数据，缺乏实时反馈。

Method: 开发了xKy设备，并在九名参与者中实施，包括家庭网关和实时监控网站。

Result: 项目提高了参与者的自用电率。

Conclusion: 实时监控基础设施有助于集体自用电参与者做出及时决策。

Abstract: As part of the energy transition and the rise in energy prices, the number of
collective self-consumption operations in France is steadily increasing.
However, energy flow monitoring currently relies on historical ''day+1'' data
provided by Linky meters, which does not offer real time feedback to help
participants adapt their energy consumption behaviors. This article introduces
a new open-source infrastructure for real-time monitoring based on Linky meter
data, enabling participants to make informed decisions and take timely actions.
It includes a description of the xKy device, applied to a collective
self-consumption operation involving nine participants, supported by the Energy
Transition Observatory (OTE). The project encompasses the implementation of
gateways in participants' homes and the development and operation of real-time
monitoring website, aimed at increasing participants' self-consumption rate.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合EEG-BCI和LLM的混合框架，用于实时适应语言康复需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AAC系统和语言学习平台无法实时适应用户的认知和语言需求，尤其是在神经疾病患者中。

Method: 利用实时EEG信号驱动LLM语言康复助手，实现个性化语言学习模块和动态任务难度调整。

Result: 系统能够通过脑电信号导航语言学习模块，并动态调整内容和难度。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为语言康复提供了实时适应性和个性化支持。

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类-AI交互研究忽视了AI系统如何潜意识地重塑人类认知，这是一个理解分布式认知的关键盲点。

Method: 通过叙事场景（个体、集体、社会层面）和“基础设施崩溃方法”揭示AI预处理的影响。

Result: CIS框架填补了认知科学、数字社会学和计算方法的学科空白，提供了研究无形算法影响的新方法。

Conclusion: CIS为跨学科研究AI预处理对认知的影响提供了新视角和方法。

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after
periods of habituation.

Abstract: This reflective paper explores often-unspoken challenges of designing and
facilitating co-design and participatory workshops, offering practical
strategies for early career researchers (ECRs) navigating these methods.
Drawing from personal experience conducting a series of workshops titled: How
to Think About Equity in the AI Ecosystem. It follows the full arc of the
workshop experience, from conceptualization and activity planning to
participant recruitment and facilitation, offering a grounded account of what
happens when participation does not go as expected. The paper examines the
methodological challenges of engaging non-expert participants, particularly
when operating without institutional support, financial incentives, or
integration into larger events. Despite initial difficulties such as low
attendance, the workshop fostered rich discussions among a demographically
diverse group and ultimately led to one participant volunteering to
co-facilitate a subsequent session. This transition from participant to
co-facilitator exemplifies the redistribution of epistemic authority,
positioning lived experience as central to research and engagement practices.
By reframing perceived failure as a productive site of learning, the paper
offers practical strategies for ECRs working across disciplines who often
navigate unfamiliar methodological terrains, contributing to broader
conversations on the realities of doing interdisciplinary, participatory work
in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脑肌接口（BMuI）的新型运动意图提取框架，以解决传统运动想象BCI中伪标签问题，并通过实验验证其可行性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动想象BCI在真实场景中因神经信号与行为意图不匹配而产生伪标签，影响解码精度和系统鲁棒性。

Method: 提出BMuI框架，模拟大脑到肌肉的神经通路，利用EMG作为高保真中继介质，提升意图识别和传输的准确性。通过离线和在线实验验证。

Result: BMuI可行，预测精度达0.8314；在线实验中所有参与者成功控制Unity虚拟手臂。

Conclusion: BMuI方法有效解决了伪标签问题，提升了BCI系统的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable real-time interaction between the
brain and external devices by decoding neural signals. However, existing
motor-based BCI paradigms, like motor imagery BCI, face challenges with
imprecise labeling in real-world use. This mismatch between EEG signals and
true behavioral intentions leads to pseudo-labels, undermining decoding
accuracy and system robustness. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper first
proposes a novel motor intention extraction framework based on a non-invasive
brain-muscle interface (BMuI)($\text{BCI} =
\frac{\text{Brain}}{\text{Computer}} \text{ Interface} =
\frac{\text{Brain}}{\not\text{Muscle}}\! \text{ (BMuI)} \times
\!\frac{\not\text{Muscle}}{\text{Computer}}\! \text{ Interface}$). This method
simulates the neural pathway from the brain to the muscles in order to capture
and enhance the weak motor intention signals originating in the brain. It then
uses EMG as a high-fidelity relay medium to achieve more accurate intention
recognition and transmission. To systematically validate the feasibility and
effectiveness of this approach, we conducted both offline experiments (to
repeatedly verify feasibility) and online experiments (to construct a real-time
interactive system and evaluate its performance). The results show that BMuI is
feasible, achieving a prediction accuracy of 0.8314; in the online experiment,
all participants are able to successfully control the Unity virtual arm.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的用户模拟器在模拟真实用户和提供定量评估方面存在不足，需要更真实、多样化的模拟器。

Method: RecUserSim包含多个模块：用户画像、记忆、核心行为（基于有限理性理论）和细化模块，以生成精细化的个性化响应。

Result: 实验表明RecUserSim能生成多样且可控的输出，对话质量高，评分在不同LLM间一致性高。

Conclusion: RecUserSim为CRS评估提供了有效的工具，尤其在真实性和多样性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Motivation: 解决急救中中风识别不一致和不准确的问题，提高诊断速度和准确性。

Method: 非医疗志愿者使用AI系统评估模拟中风患者，测量诊断准确性、完成时间、用户信心和专家审查。

Result: AI系统正确识别84%的中风症状，检测75%的大血管闭塞，用户信心高，但存在误判。专家审查后诊断准确率100%，但治疗决策信心较低。

Conclusion: 当前系统需人工监督，未来语音AI的发展有望实现高精度评估，提升急救医疗水平。

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

Abstract: The analysis of spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges due to
the complexity and heterogeneity of movement patterns. This project proposes a
data analytics tool that combines data visualization and statistical
computation to facilitate spatio-temporal data analysis through a multi-level
approach. The tool categorizes moving objects into distinct taxonomies using
Machine Learning models, adding meaningful structure to the analysis. Two case
studies demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness. The first analyzed Arctic
fox trajectories, successfully identifying and labeling foxes with Geometric or
Kinematic-based behaviors, further categorized into Curvature and Acceleration
groups. Statistical indicators revealed that foxes with Acceleration-based
behavior showed constant, steady acceleration, while those with Curvature-based
behavior exhibited acceleration peaks and sudden deceleration. The second case
study examined tropical cyclone data, labeling trajectories with Speed,
Curvature, and hybrid Geometric-based behaviors through unique statistical
variables. Analysis of hybrid Geometric behavior (Curvature and Indentation
combined) identified specific angles with the highest impact on hurricane shape
and geometry. The proposed method and tool demonstrate that spatio-temporal
data, despite inherent complexity, can be analyzed and explained in detail,
providing a theoretical and practical blueprint applicable to multiple domains.

Result: 实现了快速颜色对搜索，并在九种颜色图像上验证了嵌入信息的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了效率，适用于在LCD图像中嵌入不可察觉的信息。

Abstract: Large, high-resolution displays are installed throughout the city as public
displays. By superimposing invisible information on the images of these
displays, large numbers of devices with cameras and sensors can communicate
with the displays without prior pairing. Several applications have been
proposed, such as operating robots or communicating information to users by
displaying 2D codes on images. However, the display of 2D codes has the problem
of compromising the appearance of displayed content.
  Abe et al. proposed a method of communicating with devices by superimposing
invisible information using color vibration on images displayed on
off-the-shelf liquid-crystal displays (LCD). Using this method, we can embed
the information for devices in images without interfering with the displayed
content. Abe et al. uses a simple serial loop operation to search for color
pairs comprising a color vibration, which requires a very long processing time
due to the huge search space.
  In this paper, we propose an accelerated and optimized search method for
color pairs that constitute the imperceptible color vibration for embedding
information on LCD images. To achieve fast color pair search, we parallelized
the search process, which is previously done individually, by using arrays
representing the amount of movement and an operation to extract elements from
the array that satisfy the conditions. In addition, we investigate the amount
of information that can be superimposed on nine color images using the
imperceptible color vibration and clarify the applicability of embedding
information into images using the color vibration.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed robots to assist in the service
sector, and consequently accelerate job and sector transformation. Less
attention has been paid to the use of robots in real-world organisations where
social benefits, as opposed to profits, are the primary motivator. To explore
these opportunities, we have partnered with a working church and visitor
attraction. We conducted interviews with 15 participants from a range of
stakeholder groups within the church to understand worker perspectives of
introducing a social robot to the church and analysed the results using
reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicate mixed responses to the use of a
robot, with participants highlighting the empathetic responsibility the church
has towards people and the potential for unintended consequences. However,
information provision and alleviation of menial or mundane tasks were
identified as potential use cases. This highlights the need to consider not
only the financial aspects of robot introduction, but also how social and
intangible values shape what roles a robot should take on within an
organisation.

Conclusion: SketchMind通过多智能体协同和认知对齐，有效支持学生概念成长，具有在教育领域推广的潜力。

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在机器人系统中生成社会和文化适应性情感触觉行为的潜力。

Method: 使用GPT-3.5、GPT-4和GPT-4o生成12种情感的触觉描述，并在中、比及未指定文化背景下评估其解码和适当性。

Result: 文化匹配下六种情感解码成功；人机交互角色不对称；侵略性或亲密情感易被判定为不适当；文化不匹配降低解码准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs生成的情感触觉行为需考虑文化背景和交互角色以提高适当性和解码效果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into robotic
systems, their potential to generate socially and culturally appropriate
affective touch remains largely unexplored. This study investigates whether
LLMs-specifically GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o --can generate culturally adaptive
tactile behaviours to convey emotions in human-robot interaction. We produced
text based touch descriptions for 12 distinct emotions across three cultural
contexts (Chinese, Belgian, and unspecified), and examined their
interpretability in both robot-to-human and human-to-robot scenarios. A total
of 90 participants (36 Chinese, 36 Belgian, and 18 culturally unspecified)
evaluated these LLM-generated tactile behaviours for emotional decoding and
perceived appropriateness. Results reveal that: (1) under matched cultural
conditions, participants successfully decoded six out of twelve emotions-mainly
socially oriented emotions such as love and Ekman emotions such as anger,
however, self-focused emotions like pride and embarrassment were more difficult
to interpret; (2) tactile behaviours were perceived as more appropriate when
directed from human to robot than from robot to human, revealing an asymmetry
in social expectations based on interaction roles; (3) behaviours interpreted
as aggressive (e.g., anger), overly intimate (e.g., love), or emotionally
ambiguous (i.e., not clearly decodable) were significantly more likely to be
rated as inappropriate; and (4) cultural mismatches reduced decoding accuracy

### [150] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的自动标签放置（ALP）新方法，通过数据编辑任务和上下文感知的空间标注，解决了传统方法难以适应地图标注需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签放置对地图设计的清晰性和可解释性至关重要，但现有自动化系统难以整合制图规范或适应上下文。

Method: 利用检索增强生成（RAG）获取相关标注指南，结合指令调优的LLMs生成理想标签坐标，并在MAPLE数据集上评估性能。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在结构化提示和领域特定检索的指导下，能够生成符合制图标准的空间编辑结果。

Conclusion: 该工作为AI辅助地图标注提供了可扩展框架，展示了基础模型在结构化数据编辑任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

*Tom Peterka,Tanwi Mallick,Orcun Yildiz,David Lenz,Cory Quammen,Berk Geveci*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ChatVis是一个帮助LLM生成ParaView科学可视化Python代码的助手，无需重新训练或微调LLM，显著提升了任务完成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在高度专业化的编程任务（如科学可视化）中表现不佳，因此需要一种辅助工具来提升其能力。

Method: ChatVis采用链式思维提示简化、基于向量数据库的检索增强提示生成，以及通过迭代提示反馈进行错误检查和修正。

Result: 与未辅助的LLM相比，ChatVis在所有评估指标上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ChatVis有效解决了LLM在科学可视化任务中的局限性，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly increasing in capability, but they
still struggle with highly specialized programming tasks such as scientific
visualization. We present an LLM assistant, ChatVis, that aids the LLM to
generate Python code for ParaView scientific visualization tasks, without the
need for retraining or fine-tuning the LLM. ChatVis employs chain-of-thought
prompt simplification, retrieval-augmented prompt generation using a vector
database of documentation and code examples, and error checking with iterative
prompt feedback to correct errors until a visualization is produced. An
integral part of our approach is a benchmark suite of canonical visualization
tasks, ParaView regression tests, and scientific use cases that includes
comprehensive evaluation metrics. We evaluate our visualization assistant by
comparing results with a variety of top-performing unassisted LLMs. We find
that all the metrics are significantly improved with ChatVis.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Accessibility Scout利用大型语言模型（LLM）为残障人士提供个性化的无障碍环境扫描，结合人机协作，实现更适应性和情境感知的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动评估费时且难以扩展，而自动机器学习方法常忽略用户个性化需求，因此需要一种平衡个性化与可扩展性的解决方案。

Method: 开发基于LLM的系统Accessibility Scout，通过照片识别无障碍问题，并通过人机协作逐步个性化扫描。

Result: 技术评估和用户研究表明，该系统能生成超越传统ADA考量的个性化无障碍扫描。

Conclusion: 研究为构建更具扩展性和个性化的物理世界无障碍评估提供了新思路，并展望了未来发展方向。

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于被动臂传感器的网球击球分析系统Silent Impact，通过智能手表采集数据，分类准确率达88.2%，用户反馈更舒适。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网球分析设备需在主动臂或球拍上安装传感器，影响运动自然性和舒适性。

Method: 使用被动臂上的IMU传感器数据，训练神经网络分类六种击球动作，并开发端到端原型系统。

Result: 分类准确率88.2%，检测F1分数86.0%，用户研究显示被动臂方案更舒适。

Conclusion: 被动臂是网球击球分析的有效且舒适的替代方案，推动了用户友好的运动分析技术。

Abstract: Wearable technology has transformed sports analytics, offering new dimensions
in enhancing player experience. Yet, many solutions involve cumbersome setups
that inhibit natural motion. In tennis, existing products require sensors on
the racket or dominant arm, causing distractions and discomfort. We propose
Silent Impact, a novel and user-friendly system that analyzes tennis shots
using a sensor placed on the passive arm. Collecting Inertial Measurement Unit
sensor data from 20 recreational tennis players, we developed neural networks
that exclusively utilize passive arm data to detect and classify six shots,
achieving a classification accuracy of 88.2% and a detection F1 score of 86.0%,
comparable to the dominant arm. These models were then incorporated into an
end-to-end prototype, which records passive arm motion through a smartwatch and
displays a summary of shots on a mobile app. User study (N=10) showed that
participants felt less burdened physically and mentally using Silent Impact on
the passive arm. Overall, our research establishes the passive arm as an
effective, comfortable alternative for tennis shot analysis, advancing
user-friendly sports analytics.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实时预测点头时机和类型的模型，基于语音活动预测（VAP）模型，结合多任务学习和预训练，显著提升了点头预测的准确性，并成功应用于虚拟倾听系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非语言信息（如点头）在人机对话中至关重要，现有系统缺乏实时预测点头时机和类型的能力。

Method: 扩展VAP模型，结合多任务学习和预训练，实现连续实时的点头预测。

Result: 多任务学习显著提升预测效果，降低处理速率不影响准确性，主观评估优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 模型在实时性和准确性上表现优异，成功应用于虚拟倾听系统，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: In human dialogue, nonverbal information such as nodding and facial
expressions is as crucial as verbal information, and spoken dialogue systems
are also expected to express such nonverbal behaviors. We focus on nodding,
which is critical in an attentive listening system, and propose a model that
predicts both its timing and type in real time. The proposed model builds on
the voice activity projection (VAP) model, which predicts voice activity from
both listener and speaker audio. We extend it to prediction of various types of
nodding in a continuous and real-time manner unlike conventional models. In
addition, the proposed model incorporates multi-task learning with verbal
backchannel prediction and pretraining on general dialogue data. In the timing
and type prediction task, the effectiveness of multi-task learning was
significantly demonstrated. We confirmed that reducing the processing rate
enables real-time operation without a substantial drop in accuracy, and
integrated the model into an avatar attentive listening system. Subjective
evaluations showed that it outperformed the conventional method, which always
does nodding in sync with verbal backchannel. The code and trained models are
available at https://github.com/MaAI-Kyoto/MaAI.

Result: 推动以人为中心的MR技术创新，增强人类与虚拟自主智能体的社交互动与合作。

Conclusion: 倡导设计更具包容性、伦理性和心理安全性的MR系统，以丰富数字连接。

Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while
advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human
embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful
social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and
multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a
comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and
Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges
of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to
drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize
human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for
MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and
virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and
psychological safety in the process.

*Sebastian Gürtl,Gloria Schimetta,David Kerschbaumer,Michael Liut,Alexander Steinmaurer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DUET是一个基于LLM的工具，用于比较UML和ER图并提供反馈，旨在解决传统教学方法在可扩展性和个性化反馈方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统教学方法难以提供可扩展的个性化反馈，尤其是在大班教学中，学习者需要掌握抽象思维和复杂的语法语义。

Method: DUET将参考图和学生提交的图转换为文本表示，通过多阶段LLM管道比较差异并生成反馈。

Result: 通过半结构化访谈评估，参与者认可其可访问性、可扩展性和学习支持，但也指出可靠性和潜在滥用等限制。

Conclusion: DUET为LLM在建模教育中的应用提供了有前景的方向，并为未来课堂整合和实证评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

*Dominique Geissler,Claire Robertson,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究比较了五种数字素养干预措施，以提高人们识别深度伪造（deepfake）的能力，结果显示这些干预措施可将识别能力提升高达13个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造图像可能破坏社会信任并影响选举结果，但目前缺乏可扩展且有效的数字素养提升方法。

Method: 研究比较了五种干预措施：文本指导、视觉演示、游戏化练习、隐式学习以及AI生成原理解释，并通过1,200名美国参与者进行实验验证。

Result: 干预措施显著提升了深度伪造识别能力（提升13个百分点），同时保持对真实图像的信任。

Conclusion: 该方法是可扩展的、适用于多样化人群，并能有效提升深度伪造检测能力，同时维护对真实信息的信任。

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

TL;DR: 论文提出“超文本摩擦”概念，通过对比分析超文本与算法系统的差异，探讨如何通过设计恢复用户在算法主导环境中的自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前算法驱动的界面（如推荐系统和生成式AI工具）以牺牲用户自主性为代价追求效率和参与度，用户对内容和关系的控制减弱。

Method: 通过对比分析超文本系统（如Wikipedia、Are.na）与算法系统（如Instagram Explore、GenAI图像工具）的结构和用户体验，提出“超文本摩擦”设计理念。

Result: 超文本系统强调来源、关联思维和用户驱动的意义构建，而算法系统则模糊过程并简化参与。

Conclusion: 论文贡献了对比分析框架和“超文本摩擦”设计立场，为在算法主导的网络环境中恢复用户自主性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Today's algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds to GenAI
tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the expense of user
agency. As systems take on more decision-making, users have less control over
what they see and how meaning or relationships between content are constructed.
This paper introduces "Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that
repositions classical hypertext principles--friction, traceability, and
structure--as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically
mediated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world
interfaces--Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI image
tools--we examine how different systems structure user experience, navigation,
and authorship. We show that hypertext systems emphasize provenance,
associative thinking, and user-driven meaning-making, while algorithmic systems
tend to obscure process and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a
comparative analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven
versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers
hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency in an
increasingly algorithmic web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGC的事后解释性缺乏形式化和一致的评价标准，阻碍了研究的可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过多目标优化统一现有解释性算法，并改进评估协议（如Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@k）。

Result: 框架统一了现有方法，并支持改进的评估标准。

Conclusion: 通过统一方法和优化评估标准，提升KGC解释性研究的可重复性和影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力提升的同时，社会偏见问题凸显。研究比较了三种偏见缓解策略，发现强化学习结合1:4的样本比例能在减少偏见的同时保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在提升MLLMs推理能力的同时有效缓解其输出的社会偏见，解决两者之间的潜在权衡问题。

Method: 对比了监督微调（SFT）、知识蒸馏（KD）和基于规则的强化学习（RL）三种策略，并通过调整样本比例分析推理与偏见的权衡。

Result: 强化学习结合1:4的样本比例能减少10%的偏见，同时保留88%的推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为平衡MLLMs的公平性和能力提供了具体指导，强化学习是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 引入包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，评估GPT-4和Whisper等先进音频模型。

Result: AI模型表现极差，最高准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%。

Conclusion: 当前AI架构缺乏人类听觉场景分析的基本机制，需整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类和LLM预测中的论证一致性，以提升预测准确性。

Method: 定义论证一致性，并通过人类和LLM预测实验及用户实验验证其效果。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高准确性，但用户未普遍认同一致性。

Conclusion: 论证一致性对提升预测准确性有实际价值，需在群体预测中整合过滤机制。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化事实对查询答案的贡献，特别是在ontology-mediated查询回答中，需要高效且可扩展的责任度量计算方法。

Method: 利用数据库设置的结果，分析WSMS在不同查询类和ontology语言中的计算复杂性。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询类，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂度；对于支持合取的ontology语言，计算可能变得困难。DL-Lite方言中的某些查询类仍保持可处理性。

Conclusion: WSMS的计算复杂性取决于查询类和ontology语言，某些情况下可高效计算，而在其他情况下则不可行。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法因使用大量二进制变量而效率低下，需要更优的变量选择策略。

Method: 提出解决方案感知的ReLU评分（SAS）和全局ReLU评分（GS），结合混合MILP方法，先使用α,β-CROWN处理简单实例，再调用部分MILP。

Result: SAS将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，同时保持准确性；混合方法将未解决实例减少40%，运行时间合理。

Conclusion: SAS和混合MILP方法显著提升了验证效率，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway

we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented

external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，为LLM训练提供了更高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Conclusion: 先进的推理模型结合结构化上下文框架能显著提升因果发现能力，为跨领域任务提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Method: 提出因果解释方法，证明其形式属性，引入对比性和完整性定义，并实现高效黑盒算法。

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上表现不同，算法高效（平均6秒/图像）。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和实用性，适用于黑盒图像分类器。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Result: 实验证明DICE在多个领域有效且通用，提升代理性能。

Conclusion: DICE为LLM代理提供了一种通用、无需额外训练的动态示例选择方法。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了信任评估的开销与准确性，提升了分布式协作的效率。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Conclusion: 策略引导的代理辅助记忆回忆方法通过优化策略设计和响应生成，显著提升了记忆回忆效果，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Conclusion: TextQuests为开发更强大的AI代理提供了新的评估工具，特别关注长上下文推理能力。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Conclusion: Seed-Prover通过形式化验证和长链推理，推动了自动数学推理的显著进步。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: SimuRA展示了世界模型模拟作为推理范式的优势，为训练通用LLM代理奠定了基础，并发布了基于SimuRA的网页浏览代理供公开测试。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.
