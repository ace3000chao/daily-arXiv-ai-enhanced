Moreover,\npatient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data\nacross institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which\nrely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios.

However, the\npractical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box\ncombinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,\nchemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet\nvery important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial\noptimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the\ncategorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a\ndistance structure to the categorical kernel.

A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground\nformulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner.

Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly\nemployed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off\nbetween expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner.

While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent\napproaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and\nsubspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed\nsubspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring\nfull-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which\nmaintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order\nmomentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.\nThis factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that\nadaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,\nMoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient\nspectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment\naccumulation.

We break down abductive computational\nsystems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for\nfuture research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in\ncomputational systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5747\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u652f\u6301\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6eaf\u56e0\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Research in the area of chaining\nLLMs has found that while chaining provides transparency, controllability and\nguardrails to approach certain tasks, chaining with pre-defined LLM steps\nprevents free exploration. Using cognitive processes from creativity research\nas a basis, we create a system that addresses the inherent constraints of\nchat-based AI interactions.

However, this openness also\nintroduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space\npoisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the\ninternal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment\nmechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation\nmethods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain\ninsufficiently understood.

Evaluated on\nfive representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA\nachieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best\nbaseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR\non instruction-tuned defenses).

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal\nModels (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration\nconfiguration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the\ncontrollability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and\ncost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of\nLMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and\ninternal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image\ncaptioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies\nthrough three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.\nWe employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and\nsummarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention\ncharacteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model\nbehaviors.

While\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains\ninsufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level\nplan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce\neffective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.\nIn this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex\nReasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of\nhigh-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation.

However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Krul\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9884\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6c14\u6ce1\u6062\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "TTFT\u51cf\u5c111.5x-2.68x\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c111.33x-2.35x\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Krul\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u4e86KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our experiments reveal that extending\nSFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that\nthe primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length.

These conferences\noften rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and\ncollective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making.

Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL\ntraining framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner\nacross clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs.

Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face\nseveral limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA\nsequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high\ncomputational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are\ninefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\nframework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for\npredicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of\ntwo subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing\n(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant\nspecies. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering\npreviously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability\nanalyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing\nto its predictions.

This simple, recursive\napproach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance\nthrough parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent\nspace, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized\ndataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to\ngeneralize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2\niterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.\nAbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity\nof the task gives it an up to \\textbf{12\\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context\nlearning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\\%\nimprovement in language perplexity.

FedAKD consists of client and server\nupdates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge\ndistillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that\nwhile correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across\nclients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This\nsuggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified\nsamples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional\nknowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model\nfixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update\nthe global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The\nserver update simply aggregates all client models.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance.

Moreover, while each\ntoken activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures\nexhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple\nconsecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters.

Finally,\nwe implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and\nspeculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over\n80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS.

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u610f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5747\u53ef\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\u4f7f\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
