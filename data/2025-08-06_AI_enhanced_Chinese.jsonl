Current mobile\nsensing data highlight this intricate link using statistical and machine\nlearning analyses. We propose a novel LLM agent-based simulation framework to\nmodel student activities and mental health using the StudentLife Dataset. Each\nLLM agent was initialized with personality questionnaires and guided by\nsmartphone sensing data throughout the simulated semester. These agents predict\nindividual behaviors, provide self-reported mental health data via ecological\nmomentary assessments (EMAs), and complete follow-up personality\nquestionnaires. To ensure accuracy, we investigated various prompting\ntechniques, memory systems, and activity-based mental state management\nstrategies that dynamically update an agent's mental state based on their daily\nactivities. This simulation goes beyond simply replicating existing data. This\nallows us to explore new scenarios that are not present in the original\ndataset, such as peer influence through agent-to-agent interactions and the\nimpact of social media. Furthermore, we can conduct intervention studies by\nmanipulating activity patterns via sensing signals and personality traits using\nquestionnaire responses. This provides valuable insights into the behavioral\nchanges that could enhance student well-being. The framework also facilitates\nhypothetical interviews with LLM agents, offering deeper insights into their\nmental health.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce\ntraining costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We\npropose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel\nmethod that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on\nbusiness tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense\nreasoning.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM.

However, the\nexisting planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their\nplanning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks.

However, their complexity and\nhard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially\njailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats,\ndeveloping strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use\nof LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual\nCo-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce\nenvironments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space\ncharacteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the\neffective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations\nshow that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of\nlabeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result\nhighlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data\nis scarce.

PentestJudge is a large language model\n(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary\ntrajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a\nsecurity agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be\nimpractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree\nstructure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a\nparticular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and\ncriteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for\nPentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories\nrelated to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.\nLLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth\nreference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard\nbinary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier\nand open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an\nF1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more\nclosely to human experts.

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways.

Previous research has\naddressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a\nmulti-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach\nsuffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the\nloss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic\nthat are less appealing to human readers.\n  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to\nimprove the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core\ncomponents of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model\ncomprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most\nimportant memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory\nstorage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To\nincorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle\nframework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain\nfactors and evaluation criteria to generate outline.

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected\ndata substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal\nretrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect\ngeneralizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning\nsettings.

To\nanswer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues\nto the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue\ncorpora, and a variety of stylometric features.

To\nensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond\nefficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches\nlargely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation\nrules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we\npropose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that\nintroduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term \"Hierarchical\"\nreflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation\npipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a\nstronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical\ntaxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based\nclassification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained\nlevels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard\ndirectly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further\nenhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level\nsoft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),\npenalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation\nquality.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric.

To systematically\nevaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint\nbenchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across\ndiverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem\nincludes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary\nconstructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing\nmultimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging\nproblems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Geoint-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u5143\u7d20\u6784\u5efa\u3001Lean4\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f85\u52a9\u51e0\u4f55\u5143\u7d20\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cGeoint-R1\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Geoint-R1\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u5143\u7d20\u6784\u5efa\u3001Lean4\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b1,885\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u7684Geoint\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoint-R1\u5728\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u8f85\u52a9\u5143\u7d20\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Geoint-R1\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Geoint\u57fa\u51c6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity.

In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,\na framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding\nprocess over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we\nintroduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s\nprediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic\nvalue. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban\nRepresentation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate\nfeatures by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.\nExtensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that\nour one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage\napproaches.

In this setting, each\ndecision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial\nlogit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have\nsimultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,\nmotivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop\nalgorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy\nupdates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and\nRS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,\nrespectively.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LNN\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LLM-SS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM-SS\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph.

Such representations tend to\nobscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with\ninternal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory\nepistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure.

However, the success of these state-of-the-art\nmodels largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which\nlack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises\nquestions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.\nTo address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel\ninformation-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should\nbe a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based\non this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space\nModel (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by\noptimizing an objective function derived from our principle.

Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges.

This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience\ntargeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser\nheterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across\nadvertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity\ncreates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).\nTraditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical\nflaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific\nconstraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,\nand 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical\nrelationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we\npropose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO\nintroduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all\nexplorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via\ntrajectory reorientation.

Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models.

Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and\n$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics\nthat are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better\nat higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get\nmore effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and\nannotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5e73\u8861\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff08N\uff09\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6b21\u6570\uff08K\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u56e0\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u6b67\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\uff08N\u00d7K\uff09\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff08N, K\uff09\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u6b67\u65f6\uff0cN\u00d7K\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc71000\u5373\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14K\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u5927\u4e8e10\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5bf9K\u548cN\u7684\u6743\u8861\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous research\nhas identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision\nand natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering\nperformance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,\nit remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular\ndata tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world\napplications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular\ndata, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks\nusing five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier\nfindings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,\nwhere improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for\ntraditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the\nperception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of\nfairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that\napplies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged\ngroups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without\nnegatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance.

By\nestablishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated\nfaithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution\nsimultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby\nproviding a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer\nlearning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,\napplies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised\nexplanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local\ncorrelation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate\nhighly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing\nthe model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models\nand 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10\nmetrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and\ncross-domain generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepFaith\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5ba2\u89c2\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeepFaith\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDeepFaith\u572810\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepFaith\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping\noperators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal\nrepresentations across different architectures. Building on the insights from\nprior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a\nframework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across\nnetworks with distinct but related architectural priors.

These types of policies\nhave previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb\nconfiguration variations between agent morphologies.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the\napprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further\ndemonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the\nreward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,\nwe prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic\nmethods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPAC-EIG\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u9006\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08IRL\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684PAC\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6216\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7b56\u7565\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f20\u7edfIRL\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PAC-EIG\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5173\u4e8e\u5b66\u5f92\u7b56\u7565\u9057\u61be\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51faReward-EIG\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "PAC-EIG\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8IRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}
