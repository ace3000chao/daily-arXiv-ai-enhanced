Harnessing Discomfort to Sharpen Critical Thinking", "comment": "Presented at the 2025 ACM Workshop on Human-AI Interaction for\n  Augmented Reasoning, Report Number: CHI25-WS-AUGMENTED-REASONING", "summary": "AI-augmented systems are traditionally designed to streamline human\ndecision-making by minimizing cognitive load, clarifying arguments, and\noptimizing efficiency. However, in a world where algorithmic certainty risks\nbecoming an Orwellian tool of epistemic control, true intellectual growth\ndemands not passive acceptance but active struggle. Drawing on the dystopian\nvisions of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick - where reality is unstable,\nperception malleable, and truth contested - this paper introduces Cognitive\nDissonance AI (CD-AI): a novel framework that deliberately sustains uncertainty\nrather than resolving it. CD-AI does not offer closure, but compels users to\nnavigate contradictions, challenge biases, and wrestle with competing truths.\nBy delaying resolution and promoting dialectical engagement, CD-AI enhances\nreflective reasoning, epistemic humility, critical thinking, and adaptability\nin complex decision-making. This paper examines the theoretical foundations of\nthe approach, presents an implementation model, explores its application in\ndomains such as ethics, law, politics, and science, and addresses key ethical\nconcerns - including decision paralysis, erosion of user autonomy, cognitive\nmanipulation, and bias in AI reasoning. In reimagining AI as an engine of doubt\nrather than a deliverer of certainty, CD-AI challenges dominant paradigms of\nAI-augmented reasoning and offers a new vision - one in which AI sharpens the\nmind not by resolving conflict, but by sustaining it. Rather than reinforcing\nHuxleyan complacency or pacifying the user into intellectual conformity, CD-AI\nechoes Nietzsche's vision of the Uebermensch - urging users to transcend\npassive cognition through active epistemic struggle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03AI\uff08CD-AI\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u88ab\u52a8\u63a5\u53d7\u548c\u667a\u529b\u505c\u6ede\u3002CD-AI\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u6301\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\uff0c\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e3b\u52a8\u601d\u8003\u548c\u8fa9\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "CD-AI\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u51b3\u3001\u9f13\u52b1\u7528\u6237\u9762\u5bf9\u77db\u76fe\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "CD-AI\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c26\u900a\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u51b3\u7b56\u762b\u75ea\u548c\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u4fb5\u8680\u3002", "conclusion": "CD-AI\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfAI\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u6301\u51b2\u7a81\u800c\u975e\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u667a\u529b\u6210\u957f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based\nmodel augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract\ntabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the\nextraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,\nclassifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,\nQuantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;\n(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows.

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM\nsystems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource\nlanguages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak\nprompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art\nLlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and\n18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts.

Transformer-based LLMs face\nsignificant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,\ndue to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value\n(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions.

However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from\ntwo major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive\nitem embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low\ntraining efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network\nenvironments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud\nserver can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since\ngradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining\nthe directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors\ncompared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.\nTo accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS\nincorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nnumber of actions.

We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics.

We introduce e-Profits, a novel business-aligned\nevaluation metric that quantifies model performance based on customer-specific\nvalue, retention probability, and intervention costs. Unlike existing\nprofit-based metrics such as Expected Maximum Profit, which assume fixed\npopulation-level parameters, e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to\nestimate personalised retention rates and supports granular, per customer\nevaluation. We benchmark six classifiers across two telecom datasets (IBM Telco\nand Maven Telecom) and demonstrate that e-Profits reshapes model rankings\ncompared to traditional metrics, revealing financial advantages in models\npreviously overlooked by AUC or F1-score. The metric also enables segment-level\ninsight into which models maximise return on investment for high-value\ncustomers. e-Profits is designed as an understandable, post hoc tool to support\nmodel evaluation in business contexts, particularly for marketing and analytics\nteams prioritising profit-driven decisions.

For each image, we collected values of\ndifficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human\nrating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the\nmessage. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via\nNatural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to\nunderstand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not\ndiffer in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,\nwhile they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem\nto generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced\nexperience.

Their importance is widely recognized in the algorithmic\nfairness literature, as well as legislation and standards on\nanti-discrimination in AI. Despite this recognition, data biases remain\nunderstudied, hindering the development of computational best practices for\ntheir detection and mitigation. In this work, we present three common data\nbiases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic\ndiscrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We\nfind that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is\nless conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while\ncombinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical. Consequently,\nwe develop dedicated mechanisms to detect specific types of bias, and combine\nthem into a preliminary construct we refer to as the Data Bias Profile (DBP).\nThis initial formulation serves as a proof of concept for how different bias\nsignals can be systematically documented. Through a case study with popular\nfairness datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBP in predicting\nthe risk of discriminatory outcomes and the utility of fairness-enhancing\ninterventions.

In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm\ngeneration dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic\ntext, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation\nframework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive\nlearning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of\nsarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor\noutputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation\nquality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate\nViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including\nlarge language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.\nFurthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual\nIncongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP.

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams.

Compared to standard neural\nnetwork (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and\ndecoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model\nbased method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a\ntransmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural\nnetwork model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for\nfollow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.\nNext, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework\nover a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the\nCLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic\ninformation transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP\nmodel architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize\nsemantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay\nand energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm\nto learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus\nfinding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user.

We ask whether long CoT can be\ninduced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20\nlong CoT examples from the reasoning model \\texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly\nfine-tune the base model \\texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms\nthe much larger \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of\nhigh-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further\nexplore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced\nwith prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,\nneither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that\ncertain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze\nkey properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and\nanswer length, that influence reasoning distillation.

Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the\nbaseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches\nshow that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining\nbaseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.\n  Code is available on Github:\nhttps://github.com/szandala/fair-deepfake-detection-toolbox", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFair-FLIP\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u516c\u5171\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFair-FLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b50\u7fa4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "Fair-FLIP\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.25%\u3002", "conclusion": "Fair-FLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002"}}

The key insight that enabled their\ndevelopment was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the\nlog-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data\ndistributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)\nvia forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased\nestimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative,\nbackward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the\nscore, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results\nin proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with\nthem, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM).

To bridge this gap, this\npaper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models\n(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing\ncapability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the\nindexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual\nrelationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval.

Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,\nbipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,\nto a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this\nhas not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it\nbeing a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications\nwhere gradual semantics could be useful.

More broadly, this\nwork contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more\nrobust and reliable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBlueGlass\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cdAI\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u63d0\u5347AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u96c6\u6210\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BlueGlass\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9879\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt.

Results: The\nprojection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across\nmodalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident\ncardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were\npredictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals\nadded complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with\nthe Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance,\nachieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across\ndifferent outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the\nexternal testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data.\nThe resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into\nclinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08EEG\u3001ECG\u548c\u547c\u5438\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\uff08CVD\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CVD\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u75284,398\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57281,093\u540d\u72ec\u7acb\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u6570\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Framingham\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC 0.607-0.965\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4ecePSG\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316CVD\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

However, existing automatic\ndietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as\nrecipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter\nnutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including\nallergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information.

While imitation learning in discrete\nsettings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and\npopularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous\ndriving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the\ncompounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform\nstably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential\ncompounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled\ntrajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or\ndata augmentation.

Therefore, this study\nproposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly\nlearning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on\nusers' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware\nDataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive\nannotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors.

Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge\nlearned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning\nstrategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and\nsemantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical\ntime series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to\nachieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly\ntrained on TSF data.

However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS\ninaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and\nthe high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues\ncan coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius\nin dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient\nfor determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce\n\\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and\nefficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited\nspatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \\textsf{POIFormer} jointly\nmodels a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and\nduration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from\nuser mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's\nself-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these\ndimensions.

To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces\ntwo domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling\n(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and\nattention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential\nmolecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information\nminimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding\nfusion.

While prior\nwork has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional\narchitectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space\nmodels (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose\nunique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter\ndynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on\nGrowth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the\nimpact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM\nfor three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models\n(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance\nresilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on\nclean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)\nrobustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to\n8.8% over existing baselines.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance.

We\npropose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation\nin multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review\nsynthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial\nattacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust\nfine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research\ndirections.

Generative classifiers, in\nparticular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and\nnoisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such\nreal-time edge environments.

In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of\ngenerative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text\nclassification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We\nevaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess\ntheir robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while\ndiscriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to\nbitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized\ninference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for\nboth types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly\ndistributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and\nactivation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from\nnonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data\nduring calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths\nfor generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance.

Each region or road segment can be viewed as an\nindividual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning\n(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing\nraw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model\nupdates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each\nclient's data privacy.

Mathematically, time series can\nbe viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a\nshared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as\nlearning the transition from the historical function family to the future\nfunction family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we\nleverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships\nbetween their underlying continuous functions?

To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a\nnovel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for\nlearning path of measure between historical and future function families.

However, insights from biology suggest that the human\nhippocampus undergoes continuous neuron generation and pruning of neurons over\nthe course of learning, implying that a flexible allocation of capacity can\ncontribute to enhance performance. Real-world datasets often exhibit class\nimbalance situations where certain classes have far fewer samples than others,\nleading to significantly reduce recognition accuracy for minority classes when\nrelying on fixed size networks.To address the challenge, we propose a method\nthat periodically adds and removes neurons during training, thereby boosting\nrepresentational power for minority classes. By retaining critical features\nlearned from majority classes while selectively increasing neurons for\nunderrepresented classes, our approach dynamically adjusts capacity during\ntraining. Importantly, while the number of neurons changes throughout training,\nthe final network size and structure remain unchanged, ensuring efficiency and\ncompatibility with deployment.Furthermore, by experiments on three different\ndatasets and five representative models, we demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms fixed size networks and shows even greater accuracy when\ncombined with other imbalance-handling techniques.

However, the practical implementation of\nFederated Learning faces three primary challenges: the need for human\ninvolvement in costly data labelling processes for target adaptation, covariate\nshift in client device data collection due to environmental factors affecting\nsensors, leading to discrepancies between source and target samples, and the\nimpracticality of continuous or regular model updates in resource-constrained\nenvironments due to limited data transmission capabilities and technical\nconstraints on channel availability and energy efficiency. To tackle these\nissues, we expand upon an efficient and scalable Federated Learning framework\ntailored for real-world client adaptation in industrial settings. This\nframework leverages a pre-trained source model comprising a deep backbone, an\nadaptation module, and a classifier running on a powerful server.

To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed.

This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous\nqueries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or\nunder-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To\naddress these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user\nquery through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to\nbridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early\nmethods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from\ntoken co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or\npurchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically\ntransformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are\nbeing used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize\nthe semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user\nintent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a\ntoken classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware\ntransformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of\na token for learning superior query phrase embedding.

Often, as is the\ncase of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate\nvanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /\nlocally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time\nLQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT\nand DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like\nconditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these\ngeneralizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects\nof errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from\nadversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a\nsimulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic\ncomputations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from\nlimited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of\nthis issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of\n``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv\nskips that part (to be updated).

To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and\ngraph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse\ntasks as actions.

Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.
