Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method."}

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities."}

While this\nwork uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability\ntensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic\nproperties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to\ndirect LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a\nsynthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of\nvolume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of\nthe VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and\ninterpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The\nstudy provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,\ndemonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and\ninverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials\nwith desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made\nopen-access to support further research."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method."}

Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts\nacross diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for\nresilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for\ngenerating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically\ngenerated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are\noften too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual\nrepresentation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts\nachieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative\nadversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths\nof both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid\nred-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted\nadversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics\nand attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average\nattack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16).

However, their\nperformance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,\nremains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely\navailable, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability\nof public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we\npresent AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\nreasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular\ndata. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question\nanswering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of\nArabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where\ninitial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by\nhuman experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable\nshow that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as\ndirect question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive\nchallenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This\nindicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve\nperformance on complex tabular reasoning tasks.

Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs.

The\nsystem leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU\nsensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity,\nfrom four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going\ndownstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI\nplatform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be\ndeployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity\nclassification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant\nfeatures from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and\ndata normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier\nfor activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test\ndataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.\nAdditionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the\nrobustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power\noperation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices."}

These agents handle both structured and unstructured\ndata, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing\nrecommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs\nthe selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs\nusing tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps.

However,\nthe SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails\nto generalize to unseen samples.
