### [1] [IndoPref: A Multi-Domain Pairwise Preference Dataset for Indonesian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22159)
*Vanessa Rebecca Wiyono,David Anugraha,Ayu Purwarianti,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了IndoPref，首个完全由人类撰写、多领域的印尼语偏好数据集，用于评估大语言模型生成文本的自然性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼语在基于偏好的大语言模型研究中代表性不足，现有数据集多来自英语翻译，缺乏文化和语言真实性。

Method: 创建IndoPref数据集，所有标注均为印尼语原生撰写，并使用Krippendorff's alpha评估标注者间一致性。

Result: 数据集展示了强标注者间一致性，并用于评估多个大语言模型的输出质量。

Conclusion: IndoPref填补了印尼语偏好数据集的空白，为评估大语言模型提供了文化真实的基准。

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

### [2] [Persona-Augmented Benchmarking: Evaluating LLMs Across Diverse Writing Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22168)
*Kimberly Le Truong,Riccardo Fogliato,Hoda Heidari,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前LLM评估基准缺乏写作风格多样性，导致模型对非标准输入表现脆弱。通过基于角色的提示改写，验证了写作风格对模型性能的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准未能充分反映人类沟通的多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现不佳。

Method: 采用基于角色的LLM提示改写方法，模拟多样化写作风格。

Result: 写作风格和提示格式的变化显著影响LLM性能评估，某些风格能稳定触发高低性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展方法，增强评估基准的外部有效性，以更全面衡量LLM性能。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

### [3] [A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22187)
*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化流程，利用大语言模型（LLM）生成句子并分析其句法结构，以估计动词框架频率（VFFs），优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上受限，无法高效计算VFFs。

Method: 使用LLM生成包含476个英语动词的句子，并指导LLM像语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于广泛使用的句法分析器，且资源消耗远低于人工解析。

Conclusion: 该方法支持快速、可扩展的VFF估计，并发布了代码和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

### [4] [The role of media memorability in facilitating startups' access to venture capital funding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22201)
*L. Toschi,S. Torrisi,A. Fronzetti Colladon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 媒体记忆性（媒体在投资者记忆中留下创业公司名称的能力）显著影响风投决策，创业公司应通过突出独特性和行业相关性来增强品牌记忆性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注一般媒体曝光，忽视了媒体内容对风投决策的细微影响，因此提出媒体记忆性概念以填补这一空白。

Method: 利用197家英国微纳米技术领域创业公司（1995-2004年融资）的数据，分析媒体记忆性对投资结果的影响。

Result: 风投依赖创业公司的独特性和新闻语义网络中的连接性等详细线索做出决策，媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果。

Conclusion: 创业公司应通过更有针对性的媒体报道突出其独特性和行业相关性，而不仅追求频繁曝光，以增强品牌记忆性。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

### [5] [How Well Does First-Token Entropy Approximate Word Entropy as a Psycholinguistic Predictor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22209)
*Christian Clark,Byung-Doh Oh,William Schuler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言模型的首子词标记估计的上下文熵存在低估和失真问题，蒙特卡洛方法能更准确地估计单词熵，且与阅读时间实验结果存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨首子词标记估计的上下文熵是否准确，以及蒙特卡洛方法是否能更真实地反映单词熵。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛方法估计单词熵，并与首子词标记估计进行比较，通过阅读时间回归实验验证效果。

Result: 蒙特卡洛估计的单词熵与首子词标记估计结果存在显著差异，表明后者可能失真。

Conclusion: 建议谨慎使用首子词标记近似估计上下文熵，蒙特卡洛方法更可靠。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

### [6] [RL from Teacher-Model Refinement: Gradual Imitation Learning for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22219)
*Dongyub Jude Lee,Zhenyi Ye,Pengcheng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习方法，通过外部教师模型（GPT-4o）提供连续反馈，避免依赖静态三元组数据集，显著提升了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法（如DPO）依赖大规模静态三元组数据集且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈机制解决这一问题。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程：演员生成假设，教师模型优化，演员根据与优化结果的接近程度获得奖励。结合负编辑距离和COMET分数作为信号。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义充分性和实体保留方面均优于MT-SFT和基于偏好的基线方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和渐进学习机制，显著提升了机器翻译的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

### [7] [Meaning-infused grammar: Gradient Acceptability Shapes the Geometric Representations of Constructions in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22286)
*Supantho Rakshit,Adele Goldberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否学习到功能驱动的梯度表征，发现模型对英语双宾和介词宾结构的表征与人类偏好强度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证基于使用的构式理论（UCx）是否适用于LLMs，即模型是否学习到功能驱动的梯度表征。

Method: 分析Pythia-1.4B模型对英语双宾结构的神经表征，使用5000对句子数据集，结合几何度量（如能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度）。

Result: 模型表征的区分度与人类偏好强度相关，原型性高的句子在激活空间中更明显。

Conclusion: LLMs学习了丰富的、功能驱动的梯度构式表征，支持构式理论在模型中的几何度量。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

### [8] [Intent Recognition and Out-of-Scope Detection using LLMs in Multi-party Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22289)
*Galo Castillo-López,Gaël de Chalendar,Nasredine Semmar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合BERT和LLMs的混合方法，用于零样本和少样本场景下的意图识别和OOS检测，提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务导向对话系统需要大量标注数据，而本文旨在通过结合BERT和LLMs的优势，减少数据需求并提高性能。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合BERT的计算效率和LLMs的泛化能力，在零样本和少样本设置下进行意图识别和OOS检测。

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上评估，发现BERT输出信息共享给LLMs能提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效减少了数据需求，同时提升了意图识别和OOS检测的性能。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

### [9] [A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Negation for NLP and Neural Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22337)
*Roxana Petcu,Samarth Bhargav,Maarten de Rijke,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了否定在神经信息检索和LLM模型中的表现，提出了否定分类法、生成基准数据集，并提出了逻辑分类机制以改进模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂推理任务中的否定问题，提升神经信息检索模型在包含否定的查询中的表现。

Method: 引入否定分类法，生成两个基准数据集，提出逻辑分类机制分析检索模型性能。

Result: 分类法平衡了否定类型的数据分布，提升了NevIR数据集的收敛速度；分类模式揭示了现有数据集对否定类型的覆盖情况。

Conclusion: 提出的方法改进了模型对否定的处理能力，为未来研究提供了工具和见解。

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

### [10] [Traits Run Deep: Enhancing Personality Assessment via Psychology-Guided LLM Representations and Multimodal Apparent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22367)
*Jia Li,Yichao He,Jiacheng Xu,Tianhao Luo,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Traits Run Deep的人格评估框架，通过心理学提示和多模态融合技术，显著提升了人格评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断和个性化教育等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以建模人格语义和实现跨模态理解。

Method: 采用心理学提示引导大语言模型提取人格语义，设计文本中心的多模态融合网络，包括降维、跨模态连接和文本特征增强模块。

Result: 在AVI验证集上MSE降低约45%，在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: Traits Run Deep框架通过多模态融合和心理学提示，显著提升了人格评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

### [11] [PATENTWRITER: A Benchmarking Study for Patent Drafting with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22387)
*Homaira Huda Shomee,Suman Kalyan Maity,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了PATENTWRITER，首个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在专利摘要生成中的统一基准框架，通过多种评估指标和实验验证了LLMs的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs简化繁琐的专利申请流程，推动专利写作的范式转变。

Method: 基于专利的首个权利要求，评估六种领先的LLMs（如GPT-4和LLaMA-3）在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现，并使用多种指标（如BLEU、ROUGE等）系统评估输出质量。

Result: 实验表明，现代LLMs能生成高保真且风格合适的专利摘要，常优于领域专用基线模型。

Conclusion: PATENTWRITER为专利摘要生成提供了标准化评估工具，并开源代码和数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

Result: 评估了多种语言模型在FairytaleQA数据集上的表现，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望成为自主AI驱动英语教学的重要组成部分。

Abstract: Assessment of reading comprehension through content-based interactions plays
an important role in the reading acquisition process. In this paper, we propose
a novel approach for generating comprehension questions geared to K-2 English
learners. Our method ensures complete coverage of the underlying material and
adaptation to the learner's specific proficiencies, and can generate a large
diversity of question types at various difficulty levels to ensure a thorough
evaluation. We evaluate the performance of various language models in this
framework using the FairytaleQA dataset as the source material. Eventually, the
proposed approach has the potential to become an important part of autonomous
AI-driven English instructors.

### [13] [NeedleChain: Measuring Intact Long-Context Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22411)
*Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出NIAH基准可能高估LLMs的长上下文理解能力，并提出新基准NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction策略以更全面评估和改进LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NIAH基准可能无法准确反映LLMs的真实长上下文理解能力，需更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出NeedleChain基准，上下文全为查询相关信息，并引入ROPE Contraction策略。

Result: 实验显示即使先进LLMs（如GPT-4o）也难以完全理解长上下文，新基准揭示了性能差距。

Conclusion: NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction提供了更全面的LLMs长上下文能力评估和改进方法。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hyeonseokk/NeedleChain

*Jill Walker Rettberg,Hermann Wigers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于英美文本训练的语言模型生成的故事在文化多样性上表现不足，叙事结构高度同质化，偏向稳定与传统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能生成具有文化多样性的故事，揭示AI叙事中的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-4o-mini模型为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和文化相关性。

Result: 故事表面包含国家符号，但叙事结构单一，冲突被弱化，偏向传统与稳定。

Conclusion: AI生成的叙事存在结构性偏见，需在文化对齐和多样性上改进。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

TL;DR: Falcon-H1 是一种新型大语言模型系列，采用混合架构设计，结合 Transformer 和状态空间模型（SSM），在性能和效率上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合 Transformer 和 SSM 的优势，提升模型的长上下文记忆和计算效率，挑战传统模型设计。

Method: 采用并行混合架构，结合 Transformer 的注意力机制和 SSM 的高效性，优化模型设计、数据策略和训练动态。

Result: Falcon-H1 在多个参数规模下表现优异，旗舰模型 Falcon-H1-34B 性能媲美更大规模的模型，同时参数和数据需求更低。

Conclusion: Falcon-H1 在推理、数学、多语言任务等方面表现卓越，支持长上下文和多语言，开源发布推动 AI 研究普及。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

Result: 微调显著提升性能，但泛化能力不足，无法跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义'抽象推理'，并讨论LLMs是否符合这一标准的重要性。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过前向和后向约束生成的方法，提升Code LLMs在可控代码生成中的指令遵循能力，并引入IFEvalCode多语言基准进行更细致的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，代码生成不仅需要正确性，还需严格遵循编码风格、行数等详细要求，现有Code LLMs在此方面表现不足。

Method: 采用前向和后向约束生成方法，改进Code LLMs的指令遵循能力，并设计IFEvalCode基准（1.6K测试样本，7种语言）。

Result: 实验表明，闭源模型在可控代码生成中优于开源模型，且模型在生成正确代码与精确遵循指令之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究为可控代码生成提供了新方法，并揭示了模型在指令遵循能力上的不足，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进小型语言模型（SLMs）在Text-to-SQL任务中性能的方法，通过后训练技术（监督微调和强化学习）和自一致性推理，显著提升了SLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小型语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署方面具有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳。本文旨在探索如何通过后训练技术提升SLMs在此任务中的性能。

Method: 利用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建了两个子数据集（SynSQL-Think-916K和SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K），并采用监督微调和强化学习进行后训练，最后通过自一致性推理进行推断。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了SLMs的性能，在BIRD开发集上平均提升了31.4分，0.5B和1.5B模型的执行准确率分别达到56.87%和67.08%。

Conclusion: 本文证明了通过后训练技术可以有效提升SLMs在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，同时保持了其在推理速度和部署方面的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

TL;DR: CliCARE框架通过将电子健康记录转化为时间知识图谱，并结合临床指南，显著提升了大型语言模型在癌症决策支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理长文本和多语言电子健康记录时的不足，以及临床幻觉和不可靠评估指标的问题。

Method: 将非结构化的电子健康记录转化为患者特定的时间知识图谱，并与指南知识图谱对齐，提供决策支持。

Result: CliCARE在多个数据集上表现优于基线模型，临床有效性得到专家认可。

Conclusion: CliCARE为临床决策支持提供了高效、可靠的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Motivation: 由于缺乏反映真实客户互动的越南语基准数据集，企业难以选择合适的轻量级开源ViLLMs模型用于客户支持应用。

Method: 研究团队从越南一家大型软件公司的真实客户互动中收集了9,000多个问答对，构建了CSConDa数据集，并开发了一个综合评估框架，对11个轻量级开源ViLLMs进行了自动指标和句法分析。

Result: 研究揭示了模型的优势和不足，解释了性能差异，并指出了改进的关键领域。

Conclusion: 通过建立稳健的基准和系统评估，该研究为越南语LLMs的发展提供了支持，并推动了客户服务问答系统的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

TL;DR: ControlMed是一种医疗语言模型，通过细粒度控制标记允许用户动态调整推理长度，解决了现有推理LLMs在临床环境中因冗长推理过程导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策对准确性和解释性要求高，但现有推理LLMs因推理过程冗长导致计算开销和延迟，限制了实际应用。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）在大规模合成医疗指令数据集上预训练；2）带有多长度推理数据和显式长度控制标记的监督微调；3）基于模型奖励信号的强化学习以提高准确性和质量。

Result: 实验表明，ControlMed在英语和韩语医疗基准测试中表现优于或接近现有最优模型，并能灵活平衡推理准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是一种实用且适应性强的解决方案，适用于临床问答和医疗信息分析。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的安全机制易受认知偏见攻击，现有方法未充分探索多偏见交互的潜力。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，生成嵌入优化偏见组合的提示词。

Result: 在30种LLM中测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏见交互是未充分探索的攻击向量，为更鲁棒的AI安全机制提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<details>

Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在多语言模型中的作用，尤其是在低资源语言中的表现。

Method: 通过干预18种语言（包括低资源语言）的语言特定神经元，比较放大效果，并使用LSS评分评估目标语言的引导效果。

Result: 最佳放大因子能有效引导输出到目标语言，但跨语言任务表现普遍下降。

Conclusion: 放大语言特定神经元对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语LLM性能落后于英语，主要由于数据稀缺、语言多样性和形态复杂性，以及现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 引入BALSAM基准，涵盖14类78个NLP任务，提供52K示例和透明平台进行盲评估。

Result: BALSAM为阿拉伯语LLM提供了统一标准和协作研究平台。

Conclusion: BALSAM有望推动阿拉伯语LLM的发展，并促进社区合作。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Motivation: 探索大模型中语言特异性神经元的机制，以理解多语言处理的内在表征。

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵（LAPE）方法分析神经元，通过语言算术（激活加减乘除）操控神经元。

Result: 发现语言特异性神经元集中在深层，非拉丁文字语言表现出更强的特异性；语言操控在多语言任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 神经元操控能有效控制语言行为，揭示了语言选择和内部表征的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Language-Neurons-Manipulation.

Result: 更大模型普遍偏向自由左翼，不同语言和模型家族间存在显著差异；干预技术能可靠操控模型的政治立场。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可控性，为未来研究和应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

Method: 提出TIRESRAG-R1框架，采用思考-检索-反思过程和多维度奖励系统（充分性奖励、推理质量奖励和反思奖励），并结合难度感知重加权策略和训练样本过滤。

Result: 在四个多跳QA数据集上，TIRESRAG-R1优于现有RAG方法，并能泛化到单跳任务。

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1通过改进推理和稳定性，显著提升了RAG方法的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

Conclusion: 该方法为幻觉感知的模型微调提供了可扩展的解决方案，并发布了可复现的Colab流程。

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Conclusion: 数据集可用于评估LLMs的区域知识、研究跨语言一致性，并推动开放问答评估指标的改进。

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，用于查询聚焦的表格摘要，通过三个阶段实现高效、可靠的摘要生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划存在模糊性和缺乏结构的问题，限制了其转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力，尤其是在多表任务中。为了解决这一问题，作者提出转向结构化表示。

Method: 1) 结构化规划生成TaSoF；2) 基于图的执行将计划步骤转换为SQL并建模依赖关系；3) 摘要生成。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表任务中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示显著提高了摘要生成的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

*Kwesi Cobbina,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中上下文学习（ICL）的位置偏差（DPP偏差），发现演示（demos）在提示中的位置对模型预测和准确性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的性能对演示的选择和顺序敏感，但此前未有人研究演示在提示中的位置对模型的影响。本文首次探索了这一位置偏差。

Method: 设计了一个系统评估流程，研究了分类、问答、摘要和推理任务中的位置偏差，并引入了两个指标（ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE）来量化影响。

Result: 实验表明，将演示放在提示开头时模型输出最稳定且准确性最高（提升高达6分），而放在用户消息末尾时会导致超过30%的预测翻转且准确性未提升。小型模型受影响最大，但大型模型在复杂任务中仍受轻微影响。

Conclusion: 演示在提示中的位置对LLMs的性能有显著影响，需在设计ICL任务时考虑这一偏差。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: IntentFlow 是一个支持动态调整写作意图的工具，通过可编辑的界面组件帮助用户更轻松地表达和调整意图，提升与大型语言模型（LLM）的协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用基于提示的界面时难以清晰表达和调整模糊、流动甚至潜意识的写作意图。

Method: IntentFlow 从用户提示中提取目标和意图，并将其作为可编辑的界面组件呈现，用户可以通过直接操作或后续提示进行修改。

Result: 在实验中，使用 IntentFlow 的用户能更轻松、详细地表达意图，并生成更符合其动态意图的输出。

Conclusion: 可编辑的意图表示帮助用户最终确定意图集，并可跨任务复用，支持一致且可迁移的 LLM 辅助写作。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are widely used for writing, users often
struggle to express their nuanced and evolving intents through prompt-based
interfaces. Intents -- low-level strategies or preferences for achieving a
writing goal -- are often vague, fluid, or even subconscious, making it
difficult for users to articulate and adjust them. To address this, we present
IntentFlow, which supports the communication of dynamically evolving intents
throughout LLM-assisted writing. IntentFlow extracts goals and intents from
user prompts and presents them as editable interface components, which users
can revise, remove, or refine via direct manipulation or follow-up prompts.
Visual links connect each component to the output segments it influences,
helping users understand model behavior. In a within-subjects study (N=12),
participants using IntentFlow, compared to a chat-based baseline, expressed
their intents more easily and in detail, engaged in more meaningful actions to
communicate intents, such as adjusting and deleting, and produced outputs that
better aligned with their evolving intents. We found that editable intent
representations help users refine and consolidate a final set of intents, which
can be reused across similar tasks to support consistent and transferable
LLM-assisted writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在混合现实中共享真实外貌带来的隐私风险，如网络滥用和欺诈。

Method: 利用身份编码生成模型的特征空间隔离身份，开发两种算法（提供差分隐私保证和精细控制身份偏移）。

Result: 成功在2D和3D生成架构中生成去标识化的虚拟化身，保护隐私的同时保留自我感知属性。

Conclusion: 该方法可在公共场景中安全使用高真实感的虚拟化身，平衡隐私保护与沉浸体验。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D avatar generation has rapidly improved in recent years, and
realistic avatars that match a user's true appearance are more feasible in
Mixed Reality (MR) than ever before. Yet, there are known risks to sharing
one's likeness online, and photorealistic MR avatars could exacerbate these
risks. If user likenesses were to be shared broadly, there are risks for cyber
abuse or targeted fraud based on user appearances. We propose an alternate
avatar rendering scheme for broader social MR -- synthesizing realistic avatars
that preserve a user's demographic identity while being distinct enough from
the individual user to protect facial biometric information. We introduce a
methodology for privatizing appearance by isolating identity within the feature
space of identity-encoding generative models. We develop two algorithms that
then obfuscate identity: \epsmethod{} provides differential privacy guarantees
and \thetamethod{} provides fine-grained control for the level of identity
offset. These methods are shown to successfully generate de-identified virtual
avatars across multiple generative architectures in 2D and 3D. With these
techniques, it is possible to protect user privacy while largely preserving
attributes related to sense of self. Employing these techniques in public
settings could enable the use of photorealistic avatars broadly in MR,
maintaining high realism and immersion without privacy risk.

Result: 用户研究表明，使用IdeaBlocks的设计师探索了112.8%更多的图像，视觉多样性提高12.5%，且探索模式更具迭代性和连续性。

Conclusion: IdeaBlocks有效支持设计师的探索需求，未来工具应更好地平衡发散与收敛支持，并更高效地捕获和利用探索意图。

Abstract: Generative AI opens new possibilities for design exploration by rapidly
generating images aligned with user goals. However, our formative study (N=7)
revealed three key limitations hindering designers' broad and efficient
exploration when interacting with these models. These include difficulty
expressing open-ended exploratory intent, lack of continuity in exploration,
and limited support for reusing or iterating on previous ideas. We propose
IdeaBlocks, where users can express their exploratory intents to generative AI
with structured input and modularize them into Exploration Blocks. These blocks
can be chained for continuous, non-linear exploration and reused across
contexts, enabling broad exploration without losing creative momentum. Our user
study with 12 designers showed that participants using IdeaBlocks explored
112.8% more images with 12.5% greater visual diversity than the baseline. They
also developed ideas in more iterative and continuous patterns, such as
branching, chaining, and revisiting ideas. We discuss design implications for
future tools to better balance divergent and convergent support during
different phases of exploration, and to capture and leverage exploratory
intents more effectively.

Conclusion: DissolvPCB展示了环保电子制造的潜力，但仍需解决技术限制并探索未来发展方向。

Abstract: We introduce DissolvPCB, an electronic prototyping technique for fabricating
fully recyclable printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) using affordable FDM
3D printing, with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a water-soluble substrate and
eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) as the conductive material. When obsolete, the
PCBA can be easily recycled by immersing it in water: the PVA dissolves, the
EGaIn re-forms into a liquid metal bead, and the electronic components are
recovered. These materials can then be reused to fabricate a new PCBA.
  We present the DissolvPCB workflow, characterize its design parameters,
evaluate the performance of circuits produced with it, and quantify its
environmental impact through a lifecycle assessment (LCA) comparing it to
conventional CNC-milled FR-4 boards. We further develop a software plugin that
automatically converts PCB design files into 3D-printable circuit substrate
models. To demonstrate the capabilities of DissolvPCB, we fabricate and recycle
three functional prototypes: a Bluetooth speaker featuring a double-sided PCB,
a finger fidget toy with a 3D circuit topology, and a shape-changing gripper
enabled by Joule-heat-driven 4D printing. The paper concludes with a discussion
of current technical limitations and opportunities for future directions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着专业活动从线下转向线上，如何在社交VR中有效促进偶发性互动成为挑战。

Method: 对16名有VR活动经验的参与者进行观察和访谈，分析其互动行为与非语言线索的真实性（verisimilitude）关系。

Result: 参与者通过评估非语言线索的真实性来调整互动策略，但缺乏系统性知识；VR平台用技术替代复杂社交机制。

Conclusion: 研究为社交VR平台设计提供了支持偶发性互动的实用建议。

Abstract: Opportunistic interactions-the unstructured exchanges that emerge as
individuals become aware of each other's presence-are essential for
relationship building and information sharing in everyday life. Yet, fostering
effective opportunistic interactions has proven challenging, especially at
professional events that have increasingly transitioned from in person to
online formats. In the current paper, we offer an in-depth qualitative account
of how people initiate opportunistic interactions in social VR. Our
participants consisted of 16 individuals with ongoing experience attending
VR-mediated events in their professional communities. We conducted extensive
observations with each participant during one or more events they attended. We
also interviewed them after every observed event, obtaining self-reflections on
their attempts to navigate opportunistic interactions with others. Our analysis
revealed that participants sought to understand the extent to which social VR
preserved the real-world meanings of various nonverbal cues, which we refer to
as verisimilitude. We detailed the unique connections between a person's
perceived verisimilitude and their social behaviors at each of the three steps
toward initiating opportunistic interactions: availability recognition,
attention capture, and ice-breaking. Across these steps, the VR platform
typically replaces complex social mechanisms with feasible technical ones in
order to function, thereby altering the preconditions necessary for a nonverbal
cue's social meanings to remain intact. We identified a rich set of strategies
that participants developed to assess verisimilitude and act upon it, while
also confirming a lack of systematic knowledge guiding their practices. Based
on these findings, we provide actionable insights for social VR platform design
that can best support the initiation of opportunistic interactions for
professional purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解影响接管性能的关键因素，以优化人车交互和自动驾驶系统设计。

Method: 通过驾驶模拟器实验，使用XGBoost模型分析SA和SC对性能的贡献。

Result: SA提升响应速度，SC对接管质量影响更大。

Conclusion: SA和SC在性能中发挥互补作用，为系统设计提供重要参考。

Abstract: When automated driving systems encounter complex situations beyond their
operational capabilities, they issue takeover requests, prompting drivers to
resume vehicle control and return to the driving loop as a critical safety
backup. However, this control transition places significant demands on drivers,
requiring them to promptly respond to takeover requests while executing
high-quality interventions. To ensure safe and comfortable control transitions,
it is essential to develop a deep understanding of the key factors influencing
various takeover performance aspects. This study evaluates drivers' takeover
performance across three dimensions: response efficiency, user experience, and
driving safety - using a driving simulator experiment. EXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models are used to investigate the contributions of two
critical factors, i.e., Situational Awareness (SA) and Spare Capacity (SC), in
predicting various takeover performance metrics by comparing the predictive
results to the baseline models that rely solely on basic Driver Characteristics
(DC). The results reveal that (i) higher SA enables drivers to respond to
takeover requests more quickly, particularly for reflexive responses; and (ii)
SC shows a greater overall impact on takeover quality than SA, where higher SC
generally leads to enhanced subjective rating scores and objective execution
trajectories. These findings highlight the distinct yet complementary roles of
SA and SC in shaping performance components, offering valuable insights for
optimizing human-vehicle interactions and enhancing automated driving system
design.

Result: 提出了接管缓冲区的概念，总结了接管时间的决定因素，并提出了标准化的性能评估方法。

Conclusion: 论文为未来研究提供了系统框架，强调了适应性时间预算的重要性，并提出了六个研究方向。

Abstract: Conditionally automated driving systems require human drivers to disengage
from non-driving-related activities and resume vehicle control within limited
time budgets when encountering scenarios beyond system capabilities. Ensuring
safe and comfortable transitions is critical for reducing driving risks and
improving user experience. However, takeovers involve complex human-vehicle
interactions, resulting in substantial variability in drivers' responses,
especially in takeover time, defined as the duration needed to regain control.
This variability presents challenges in setting sufficient time budgets that
are neither too short (risking safety and comfort) nor too long (reducing
driver alertness and transition efficiency).
  Although previous research has examined the role of time budgets in
influencing takeover time and performance, few studies have systematically
addressed how to determine sufficient time budgets that adapt to diverse
scenarios and driver needs. This review supports such efforts by examining the
entire takeover sequence, including takeover time, time budget, and takeover
performance. Specifically, we (i) synthesize causal factors influencing
takeover time and propose a taxonomy of its determinants using the
task-capability interface model; (ii) review existing work on fixed and
adaptive time budgets, introducing the concept of the takeover buffer to
describe the gap between takeover time and allocated time budget; (iii) present
a second taxonomy to support standardized and context-sensitive measurement of
takeover performance; (iv) propose a conceptual model describing the
relationships among takeover time, time budget, and performance; and (v)
outline a research agenda with six directions.

Abstract: Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) have the potential --
and already are being used -- to increase the speed, scale, and types of unsafe

unsafe conversations in particular because of their ability to generate
persuasive and human-like text. In our current work, we explore ways to promote
online safety by teaching people about unsafe conversations that can occur
online with and without LLMs. We build on prior work that shows that LLMs can
successfully simulate scam conversations. We also leverage research in the
learning sciences that shows that providing feedback on one's hypothetical
actions can promote learning. In particular, we focus on simulating scam
conversations using LLMs. Our work incorporates two LLMs that converse with
each other to simulate realistic, unsafe conversations that people may
encounter online between a scammer LLM and a target LLM but users of our system
are asked provide feedback to the target LLM.

*Phuc Truong Loc Nguyen,Thanh Hung Do*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Con-GaIT是一个面向临床医生的AI辅助步态分析系统，通过透明界面和可争议机制提升AI决策的可解释性和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床仪表板缺乏透明度，无法让医生质疑AI决策，因此需要一种更透明、可争议的系统来改善帕金森病护理。

Method: 基于HCI原则，设计了Con-GaIT系统，支持通过视觉解释、角色反馈和可追溯日志实现结构化争议。

Result: 系统在可争议性评估分数（CAS）中达到0.970，证明其设计符合新兴监管标准。

Conclusion: Con-GaIT通过人本设计成功实现了AI决策的可争议性，为临床实践提供了透明和可操作的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-assisted gait analysis holds promise for improving Parkinson's Disease
(PD) care, but current clinical dashboards lack transparency and offer no
meaningful way for clinicians to interrogate or contest AI decisions. We
present Con-GaIT (Contestable Gait Interpretation & Tracking), a
clinician-centered system that advances Contestable AI through a tightly
integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural
recourse. Grounded in HCI principles, ConGaIT enables structured disagreement
via a novel Contest & Justify interaction pattern, supported by visual
explanations, role-based feedback, and traceable justification logs. Evaluated
using the Contestability Assessment Score (CAS), the framework achieves a score
of 0.970, demonstrating that contestability can be operationalized through
human-centered design in compliance with emerging regulatory standards. A
demonstration of the framework is available at

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了女性主义创客空间如何通过关怀、互助和集体知识生产实现长期可持续发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究女性主义创客空间如何在结构性不稳定的环境中持续存在，填补了现有CSCW研究的空白。

Method: 通过对美国8个女性主义创客空间的18位创始人和成员的访谈，结合自民族志反思。

Result: 研究发现，可持续性并非通过增长或制度化实现，而是通过关怀驱动的管理、与本地正义运动的团结以及共享治理。

Conclusion: 女性主义创客空间通过日常实践中的社会行为成为预演性反空间，展示了替代性社会技术基础设施的可能性。

Abstract: Feminist makerspaces offer community led alternatives to dominant tech
cultures by centering care, mutual aid, and collective knowledge production.
While prior CSCW research has explored their inclusive practices, less is known
about how these spaces sustain themselves over time. Drawing on interviews with
18 founders and members across 8 U.S. feminist makerspaces as well as
autoethnographic reflection, we examine the organizational and relational
practices that support long-term endurance. We find that sustainability is not
achieved through growth or institutionalization, but through care-driven
stewardship, solidarity with local justice movements, and shared governance.
These social practices position feminist makerspaces as prefigurative
counterspaces - sites that enact, rather than defer, feminist values in
everyday practice. This paper offers empirical insight into how feminist
makerspaces persist amid structural precarity, and highlights the forms of
labor and coalition-building that underpin alternative sociotechnical
infrastructures.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在VR环境中使用LLM驱动的虚拟代理时，如何通过对话填充物（如手势和语言提示）缓解响应延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VR中LLM虚拟代理的响应延迟对用户体验的负面影响。

Method: 使用对话填充物（手势和语言提示）在不同延迟水平和交互场景下评估其效果。

Result: 延迟超过4秒会降低体验质量，而自然的对话填充物能改善感知响应时间，尤其在延迟较高时。

Conclusion: 研究为优化用户参与提供了见解，并贡献了一个开源工具链，便于在虚拟环境中部署对话代理。

Abstract: We investigated the challenges of mitigating response delays in free-form
conversations with virtual agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
within Virtual Reality (VR). For this, we used conversational fillers, such as
gestures and verbal cues, to bridge delays between user input and system
responses and evaluate their effectiveness across various latency levels and
interaction scenarios. We found that latency above 4 seconds degrades quality
of experience, while natural conversational fillers improve perceived response
time, especially in high-delay conditions. Our findings provide insights for
practitioners and researchers to optimize user engagement whenever
conversational systems' responses are delayed by network limitations or slow
hardware. We also contribute an open-source pipeline that streamlines deploying
conversational agents in virtual environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手势识别技术难以处理由手指和手部运动自然性导致的不精确问题，影响了人机交互体验。

Method: 采用模糊提示点击点技术，通过二维模糊集匹配用户手绘手势与预存参考手势。

Result: 该方法能更灵活地处理手势交互中的不精确问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为人机交互中的手势识别提供了更高的容忍度和灵活性。

Abstract: This paper presents a two-dimension fuzzy set based approach for matching
touch-based gestures using fuzzy cued click point technique. The pro posed
approach aims mainly to improve the acceptance of the most closed inac curate
hand drawn gestures generated by the user compared with a predefined referenced
gesture value that is stored in the user profile. Commonly, gestures are used
in order to facilitate the interactive capabilities between humans and
computerized systems. Unfortunately, most of current gesturing techniques don't
deal at the same level of inaccuracy of gesturing, resulted from the nature of
hu man fingers and hands movements. This paper aims, in a more flexible manner,
to tackle the inaccuracy problem existed with gesture-based interactions
between humans and a computerized system.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究指出，传统用户体验（UX）评估方法对聋人用户存在局限性，需改进以适应其独特需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UX评估方法主要为听力用户设计，无法满足聋人用户的交互、感知和理解需求，导致评估不完整或偏颇。

Method: 分析一组针对聋人用户推荐的UX评估方法，验证其可访问性并指出局限性。

Result: 尽管这些方法在文献中常被推荐，但仍存在需改进的局限性，以适应聋人群体的沟通特点。

Conclusion: 需改进评估方法，确保聋人用户的可访问性，以准确反映其体验和需求。

Abstract: User Experience (UX) evaluation methods that are commonly used with hearing
users may not be functional or effective for Deaf users. This is because these
methods are primarily designed for users with hearing abilities, which can
create limitations in the interaction, perception, and understanding of the
methods for Deaf individuals. Furthermore, traditional UX evaluation approaches
often fail to address the unique accessibility needs of Deaf users, resulting
in an incomplete or biased assessment of their user experience. This research
focused on analyzing a set of UX evaluation methods recommended for use with
Deaf users, with the aim of validating the accessibility of each method through
findings and limitations. The results indicate that, although these evaluation
methods presented here are commonly recommended in the literature for use with
Deaf users, they present various limitations that must be addressed in order to
better adapt to the communication skills specific to the Deaf community. This
research concludes that evaluation methods must be adapted to ensure accessible
software evaluation for Deaf individuals, enabling the collection of data that
accurately reflects their experiences and needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解学生在不同编程课程中如何使用氛围编程平台Replit，以及背景如何影响其交互方式。

Method: 通过访谈和有声思维法记录学生使用Replit构建Web应用的过程，并进行主题分析。

Result: 两组学生主要用Replit测试或调试，高级学生更常包含应用功能和代码库上下文。

Conclusion: 编程背景显著影响学生与氛围编程平台的交互方式，高级学生更注重上下文。

Abstract: Background and Context. Chat-based and inline-coding-based GenAI has already
had substantial impact on the CS Education community. The recent introduction
of ``vibe coding'' may further transform how students program, as it introduces
a new way for students to create software projects with minimal oversight.
  Objectives. The purpose of this study is to understand how students in
introductory programming and advanced software engineering classes interact
with a vibe coding platform (Replit) when creating software and how the
interactions differ by programming background.
  Methods. Interview participants were asked to think-aloud while building a
web application using Replit. Thematic analysis was then used to analyze the
video recordings with an emphasis on the interactions between the student and
Replit.
  Findings. For both groups, the majority of student interactions with Replit
were to test or debug the prototype and only rarely did students visit code.
Prompts by advanced software engineering students were much more likely to
include relevant app feature and codebase contexts than those by introductory
programming students.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了独立学习编程的挑战，并提出了一种通过AI生成反馈的在线平台，支持学习者的自我调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自学编程的人面临孤立、信息过载和缺乏指导的问题，而社交媒体上的自我调节实践（如求助、反思）未被充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个结合网页平台和浏览器扩展的系统，通过AI生成反馈将学习活动转化为故事，招募15名学习者测试。

Result: 用户反馈显示系统在支持自我调节方面可行，尤其赞赏实时反思、自动故事反馈和视频注释功能。

Conclusion: 系统展示了AI增强自我调节工具的潜力，同时指出了未来设计的机会和挑战。

Abstract: Many people learn programming independently from online resources and often
report struggles in achieving their personal learning goals. Learners
frequently describe their experiences as isolating and frustrating, challenged
by abundant uncertainties, information overload, and distraction, compounded by
limited guidance. At the same time, social media serves as a personal space
where many engage in diverse self-regulation practices, including help-seeking,
using external memory aids (e.g., self-notes), self-reflection, emotion
regulation, and self-motivation. For instance, learners often mark achievements
and set milestones through their posts. In response, we developed a system
consisting of a web platform and browser extensions to support self-regulation
online. The design aims to add learner-defined structure to otherwise
unstructured experiences and bring meaning to curation and reflection
activities by translating them into learning stories with AI-generated
feedback. We position storytelling as an integrative approach to design that
connects resource curation, reflective and sensemaking practice, and narrative
practices learners already use across social platforms. We recruited 15
informal programming learners who are regular social media users to engage with
the system in a self-paced manner; participation concluded upon submitting a
learning story and survey. We used three quantitative scales and a qualitative
survey to examine users' characteristics and perceptions of the system's
support for their self-regulation. User feedback suggests the system's
viability as a self-regulation aid. Learners particularly valued in-situ
reflection, automated story feedback, and video annotation, while other
features received mixed views. We highlight perceived benefits, friction
points, and design opportunities for future AI-augmented self-regulation tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测量教育存在后勤和认知挑战，阻碍学生参与和学习效果，需要更灵活、适应性强的学习工具。

Method: 开发了VRISE，提供交互式模块，支持地面和空中测量任务，结合自适应界面和实时反馈。

Result: 评估显示VRISE显著提高了测量准确性、任务效率和技能发展，降低了认知负荷。

Conclusion: VRISE展示了沉浸式数字环境在测量教育中的潜力，能安全、高效地提升核心能力。

Abstract: Surveying is a core component of civil engineering education, requiring
students to engage in hands-on spatial measurement, instrumentation handling,
and field-based decision-making. However, traditional instruction often poses
logistical and cognitive challenges that can hinder accessibility and student
engagement. While virtual laboratories have gained traction in engineering
education, few are purposefully designed to support flexible, adaptive learning
in surveying. To address this gap, we developed Virtual Reality for Immersive
and Interactive Surveying Education (VRISE), an immersive virtual reality
laboratory that replicates ground-based and aerial surveying tasks through
customizable, accessible, and user-friendly modules. VRISE features interactive
experiences such as differential leveling with a digital level equipment and
waypoint-based drone navigation, enhanced by input smoothing, adaptive
interfaces, and real-time feedback to accommodate diverse learning styles.
Evaluation across multiple user sessions demonstrated consistent gains in
measurement accuracy, task efficiency, and interaction quality, with a clear
progression in skill development across the ground-based and aerial surveying
modalities. By reducing cognitive load and physical demands, even in tasks
requiring fine motor control and spatial reasoning, VRISE demonstrates the
potential of immersive, repeatable digital environments to enhance surveying
education, broaden participation, and strengthen core competencies in a safe
and engaging setting.

Abstract: In spite of all advances promoted by information technologies, there are
still activities where this technology is not applied for reasons such as being
carried out in non-profit organizations or because they have not adapted to
this modernization. Until recently, the way to work with mobile devices was
either by connecting through a web page with the device's browser, or by
downloading an application from the corresponding platform. But lately,
technologies are being developed that aim to break with this, as in the case of
Progressive Web Applications (PWA). One of the advantages offered by PWA is to
access the web page and install it as an application on the device. The purpose
of this article is to design a progressive Web application for the support of
Storytelling Therapy, one of the novel therapies applied in the field of mental
health. In addition to providing a software application to enhance Storytelling
Therapy workshops, it is also intended to analyze and verify the advantages of
PWA in a real case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIMR框架通过上下文感知的迭代推理和自我修正，显著提升了多模态复杂任务的性能，准确率达91.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在复杂多模态指令处理上表现不足，需逻辑推理和动态反馈整合。

Method: 提出CIMR框架，分两阶段：初始推理与迭代优化，结合动态融合模块整合多模态特征。

Result: 在MAP数据集上，CIMR以91.5%准确率超越GPT-4V等模型。

Conclusion: CIMR的迭代推理和自我修正能力在复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate
human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle
with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical
reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To
address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a
novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and
self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and
response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal
feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and
contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual
Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced
Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy,
outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5
(78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the
efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应伪标签框架，通过原型一致性和邻域一致性提升CLIP的无监督适应性能，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督适应中，伪标签噪声大，传统固定阈值方法不可靠，需更动态的伪标签优化方法。

Method: 结合PICS（基于类内紧凑性和类间分离性评估伪标签准确性）和NALR（利用邻域语义相似性动态优化伪标签），并引入自适应加权机制。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实现最优性能，提供更准确的伪标签且计算高效。

Conclusion: 自适应伪标签框架显著提升CLIP的无监督适应能力，为复杂视觉场景提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP,
pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant
noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios.
Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence
thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work,
we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's
adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and
neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key
components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class
feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which
exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine
pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting
mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training
according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in
unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while
maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感的问题，即使微小改动也可能导致输出不一致或不准确。

Method: 采用闭环框架，每生成一步后通过预训练的多模态大语言模型分析图像与提示，检测偏差并生成优化后的提示，迭代改进。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上提升了生成图像与提示的对齐性和视觉一致性，且兼容黑盒模型。

Conclusion: TIR通过迭代优化提示，显著改善了文本到图像生成的质量，无需额外训练，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still
struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can
yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we
introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no
additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,
each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained
multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's
prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect
attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next
round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying
alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the
iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this
closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple
benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with
black-box T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着有限元模拟精度提高但计算成本增加，数据驱动设计需求增长，需要高效优化方法。BO和MFBO虽已成功应用，但缺乏在真实工程问题（如超材料设计）中的直接比较。此外，采样质量和设计参数敏感性分析在数据驱动设计中常被忽视。

Method: 采用Sobol'样本和基于方差的敏感性分析降低设计问题复杂度，并比较BO和MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题中的性能。

Result: MFBO在优化自旋体结构EA问题时表现优于BO，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: MFBO是一种高效的多保真技术，适用于昂贵的数据驱动设计问题，研究结果支持其广泛应用。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting
increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a
collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand
of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient
optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously
established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In
parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an
objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The
multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also
seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison
with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial
design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and
assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of
data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing
Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce
design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements,
applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the
energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned.
The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a
spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various
hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to
support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven
design problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新型混合激活函数S3和S4，解决了传统激活函数如ReLU和sigmoid的问题，并通过实验验证了S4在多种任务中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数如ReLU存在神经元死亡问题，sigmoid和tanh存在梯度消失问题，需要设计更优的激活函数以提升神经网络性能。

Method: 提出S3（Sigmoid-Softsign混合）和S4（改进版S3），S4通过平滑过渡机制和可调参数k优化性能。

Result: S4在MNIST、Iris分类和Boston Housing回归任务中表现优异，准确率分别为97.4%、96.0%和18.7 MSE，收敛速度更快且梯度稳定。

Conclusion: S4通过混合设计和平滑过渡机制解决了现有激活函数的局限性，是深度学习应用中的多功能选择。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks,
directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance.
Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid
and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid
activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4
(smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for
positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a
steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary
classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three
different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance
compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on
MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression.
The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable
gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's
gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep
networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing
functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The
tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths,
making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings
suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for

### [62] [Spatial-Temporal Reinforcement Learning for Network Routing with Non-Markovian Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22174)
*Molly Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图神经网络（GNN）和循环神经网络（RNN）的时空强化学习方法，以解决传统RL在通信网络路由优化中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL基于马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），假设环境状态完全决定系统演化，但实际场景中这一假设不成立。此外，传统RL方法未能显式捕捉复杂网络拓扑的空间关系，导致路由决策不理想。

Method: 提出了一种时空RL方法，利用GNN捕捉网络拓扑的空间动态，RNN捕捉时间流量模式，从而优化路由决策。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和对网络拓扑变化的鲁棒性上优于传统RL技术。

Conclusion: 时空RL方法通过结合GNN和RNN，有效解决了通信网络路由优化中的空间和时间动态问题，提升了决策效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for
optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms
typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that
the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for
system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is
invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks
inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL
algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that
do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments
with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by
dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which
further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we
propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial
dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns,
respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network
topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

*Ambarish Singh,Romila Pradhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了SourceGrasp和SourceSplice两种框架，用于高效选择数据源子集以优化下游机器学习模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据发现方法未考虑数据源质量对机器学习任务性能的影响，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SourceGrasp采用基于贪婪准则和随机化的元启发式方法，SourceSplice则借鉴基因剪接概念进行数据源选择。

Result: 实验表明，SourceSplice能以较少子集探索高效识别高质量数据源组合。

Conclusion: SourceSplice在多种设置下表现出对决策选择的敏感性，能显著提升任务效用。

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine
learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources
available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on
metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be
joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for
high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of
determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct
the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and
SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of
sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the
algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations)
contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously
chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness
criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source
selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in
protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world
datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset
explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources
leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity
of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的时间序列数据集相似性度量方法，通过将数据集视为多元正态分布的实例来计算相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列基础模型研究的兴起需要衡量时间序列数据集的相似性，以支持模型选择、微调和可视化等研究。

Method: 将时间序列数据集视为多元正态分布的实例，利用Wasserstein距离计算数据集之间的相似性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效识别相似数据集，并在分布外和迁移学习评估中与推理损失高度相关（>0.60）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间序列数据集相似性度量中表现有效，为模型性能估计提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing
need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series
dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model
selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a
distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by
leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an
empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution
(MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the
Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive
experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach.
Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar
time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of
foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation,
with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss
(>0.60).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前远程胎儿监测系统缺乏可解释性，父母难以理解原始CTG数据。

Method: 利用多代理LLM系统，将CTG信号分解为五个医学特征，由专用代理分析，最终汇总输出。

Result: 在NeuroFetalNet数据集上，CTG-Insight达到96.4%的准确率和97.8%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可解释且可扩展的CTG分析框架。

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet,
most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents
with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this
work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured
interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG
trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability,
accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a
dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a
holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language
explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare
it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show
that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score
(97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work
contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型结合SHAP方法在中长期电力负荷预测中具有潜力，为决策提供透明支持。

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric
power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather
variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential
for long-term planning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine
learning models, Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), for forecasting system-wide electricity load up to one year in
advance. Midterm forecasting has shown to be crucial for maintenance
scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market
participation. The paper places a focus on the use of a method called "Shapley
Additive Explanations" (SHAP) to improve model explainability. SHAP enables the
quantification of feature contributions, guiding informed feature engineering
and improving both model transparency and forecasting accuracy.

Result: 在竞赛中显著领先，多模态模型在高阶联合皮层表现优于单模态模型。

Conclusion: TRIBE为构建统一的人类大脑表征模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized
domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While
fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of
cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to
predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas
and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and
video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a
transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI
responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain
encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show
that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical
networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically
outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices.
Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way
towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

Result: 验证了通过多轮退火运行可以更准确地估计数据源的缩放行为，优化资源分配。

Conclusion: 该方法支持数据驱动的数据源选择和优化，适用于不同领域和计算资源。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction
in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to
estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered
web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation
for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka
annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to
specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka
micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing
runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a
key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data
scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across
compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically
analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling
curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can
inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition
methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and
available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a
pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain
well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain
underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that
one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running
multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used
point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables
data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式——表征赋权（representational empowerment），强调通过内部知识结构的可控维护和多样化来实现智能体的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能追求聚焦于外部目标（如环境控制或任务掌握），导致智能体缺乏适应性。作者希望通过内部表征赋权实现更灵活的学习。

Method: 提出表征赋权，以内部知识结构为计算赋权的主要基础，衡量智能体可控维护和多样化知识的能力。

Result: 表征赋权为设计适应性智能系统提供了新视角，强调内部理解能力对“准备性”的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过将控制焦点转向内部表征，表征赋权为通用智能体的设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external
objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific
tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack
adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective
towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control
inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and
diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape
one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness''
distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal
representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new
lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: W-CFM通过加权CFM损失改进条件流匹配，提升生成效率与准确性，避免高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFM生成的路径偏离直线插值，导致生成速度慢且不准确，需改进。

Method: 提出加权条件流匹配（W-CFM），通过Gibbs核加权训练对，近似熵最优传输耦合。

Result: W-CFM在合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线，保持计算效率。

Conclusion: W-CFM在性能和效率上优于传统方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for
training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and
effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate
significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target
distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for
fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by
inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on
computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights
from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow
Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by
weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this
weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals,
and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly
unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the
minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes
computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we
test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real
datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality,
fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the
computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于聚类的交叉验证策略，提出了一种结合Mini Batch K-Means和类别分层的新技术，并在不同数据集上验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统交叉验证可能因数据子集代表性不足导致的性能估计偏差问题。

Method: 提出结合Mini Batch K-Means和类别分层的新交叉验证技术，并在20个数据集上对比不同策略的偏差、方差和计算成本。

Result: 在平衡数据集上，新方法在偏差和方差上表现更优；在不平衡数据集上，传统分层交叉验证更优。聚类算法无单一最优选择。

Conclusion: 研究改进了模型评估策略，验证了聚类数据分割技术的潜力，并肯定了传统分层交叉验证的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling
robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on
training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to
create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of
the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The
objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based
cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different
clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new
cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class
stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both
balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing
cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost.
The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification
outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though
it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets,
traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing
lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for
performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of
different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as
superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model
evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of
cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of
well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it
highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model
evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

Abstract: With the rapid amassing of spatial-temporal (ST) ocean data, many
spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address
various oceanic issues, including climate forecasting and disaster warning.
Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more
complicated but with unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high
sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM
models on ST ocean data. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey
of existing studies remains missing in the literature, which hinders not only
computer scientists from identifying the research issues in ocean data mining
but also ocean scientists to apply advanced STDM techniques. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive survey of existing STDM studies for ocean science.
Concretely, we first review the widely-used ST ocean datasets and highlight
their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement
techniques are explored. Next, we classify existing STDM studies in ocean
science into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern
mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate on the techniques for these tasks.
Finally, promising research opportunities are discussed. This survey can help
scientists from both computer science and ocean science better understand the
fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM for ocean
science.

Motivation: 解决稀疏传感器布局、噪声测量和不完整数据采集等场景下的信号恢复问题。

Method: 1. 在SHRED架构中引入CS技术，采用基于批处理的前向框架和ℓ1正则化；2. 设计自适应损失函数，动态结合MSE和MAE，并加入分段信噪比（SNR）正则化。

Result: 在多种复杂问题（如粘弹性流体流动、海面温度分布等）中，CS-SHRED显著提高了重建保真度（SSIM、PSNR等指标优于传统SHRED）。

Conclusion: CS-SHRED通过联合训练CS和SHRED架构，结合LSTM序列模型和浅层解码网络，成为一种在环境、气候和科学数据分析中具有广泛应用前景的工具。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.

Conclusion: MH-pFedHN为模型异构的个性化联邦学习提供了高效、隐私友好的解决方案，可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing
client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require
external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies,
which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit
hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization
capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous
personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which
leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding
vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's
heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we
introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with
similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose
MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve
generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not
require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced
privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model
settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong
generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in
model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FLPO问题是NP难问题，具有混合离散-连续结构和高度非凸目标，传统方法难以高效解决。

Method: 通过将最大熵原理（MEP）与最短路径网络（SPN）结合，SPN是一种置换不变的编码器-解码器，能够高效计算梯度和策略推断。

Result: SPN比MEP基线快100倍，最优性差距约6%；FLPO方法比元启发式基线成本低10倍，速度更快，与Gurobi最优解匹配但快1500倍。

Conclusion: 结构化深度模型在大规模混合整数优化任务中表现出色，为ParaSDM问题设定了新标准。

Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential
decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete
action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this
setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where
multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility
locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the
network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous
structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest
Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates
the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over
shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy
inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average
optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our
FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines
while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with
annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for
ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models
for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 随着DNN在移动和边缘设备上的部署增加，模型效率优化变得至关重要。混合精度量化虽优于均匀量化，但找到每层最优精度仍具挑战性。现有方法存在训练复杂性和高GPU内存需求的问题。

Method: MSQ采用圆钳位量化器实现权重的可微分计算，并通过正则化诱导稀疏性，避免显式的位级参数分割。结合Hessian信息，同时修剪多个LSB以提升训练效率。

Result: 实验显示，MSQ相比之前的位级量化方法，可减少8倍可训练参数和86%的训练时间，同时保持高精度和压缩率。

Conclusion: MSQ是一种适用于资源受限设备的高效DNN训练方法。

Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge
devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision
quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between
efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the
optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing
bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial
training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that
addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable
differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model
weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,
enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter
splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the
simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.
Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable
parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous
bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression
rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on
resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了随机森林的可解释性，无需分析每棵树或依赖简化总结。

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify
datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random
forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single
decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a
visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests.
We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model
performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in
detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To
meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric
that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a
pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that
visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot,
which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees,
and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision
trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the
"Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning
dataset, as well as a small user study.

TL;DR: Spec-VLA框架通过改进推测解码技术，显著加速了Vision-Language-Action模型的推理速度，同时保持成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action模型因参数规模和自回归解码特性导致计算需求高，推测解码技术虽在大型语言模型中有效，但在VLA模型中应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出Spec-VLA框架，通过利用动作令牌的相对距离放松接受机制，提升生成速度。

Result: 实验表明，Spec-VLA框架将接受长度提升44%，速度提升1.42倍，且不影响成功率。

Conclusion: Spec-VLA框架展示了推测执行在VLA预测场景中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by
leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However,
VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose
considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding
(SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple
tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models
remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to
accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and
the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the
advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed
improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism
to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action
tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm
the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates
the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by
44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without
compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights
the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA
prediction scenarios.

Conclusion: T-MIFPE能有效减少浮点误差，提升对抗攻击的准确性和鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often
suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation
induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study
of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four
distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful
untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful
targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the
behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions,
revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and
identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on
this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which
incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of
floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation
in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss
functions, including CE, C\&W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and
robustness evaluation accuracy.

Conclusion: RANA通过有效处理噪声和标签稀疏性，显著提升了网络对齐模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields.
However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity,
while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can
substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes
structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced
and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust
Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles
both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor
link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models.
Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the
Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise,
respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization
objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address
structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion
denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide
more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active
learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: RCR-AF在标准训练和对抗训练中均优于ReLU、GELU和Swish。

Conclusion: RCR-AF通过理论分析和实验验证，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their widespread success, deep neural networks remain critically
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks in safety-sensitive
applications. This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet
underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher
Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function
designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF
uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient
stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable
monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity
through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$
and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,
demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher
complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used
alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard
training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting
clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have
shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to
process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to
deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In
this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance
of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful
explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive
reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and
interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary
models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each
prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare
that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

Result: 实验证明Proto-EVFL在零样本场景下优于基线至少6.97%。

Conclusion: Proto-EVFL是VFL中首个双层优化框架，具有1/√T的收敛速度，能有效解决类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned
sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate
collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in
VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature
representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically,
class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and
inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and
feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above
challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual
prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn
relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to
predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype
learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal
transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided
module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior
probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation
strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically
weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved
that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a
convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets
validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with
one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

Result: 在图像分类和生成任务中显著缩小现有MU方法与精确遗忘的差距，减少有害内容生成。

Conclusion: LoReUn是一种简单高效的插件式方法，能有效提升机器遗忘效果。

Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content,
which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical
technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU
methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which
makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn
than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data
itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight,
we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective
plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning
process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach
significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning
in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the
prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must
satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature
over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend
reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal
theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to
those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper
addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of
nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an
exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces
with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees
for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for
general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical
adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon
publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation
procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug
discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular
properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent
advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of
neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language
modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning
models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented
by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we
present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield
improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction
benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and
previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that
data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these
domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the
model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier
and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower

Conclusion: FGFP框架在模型压缩和精度保持上优于现有方法，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent
years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge
devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network
parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To
address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)
framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian
function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the
computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we
introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the
fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each
kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional
Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured
Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various
architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent
methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a
1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012,
ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant
issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays,
increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a
robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We
implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding
Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict
congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban
Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN
predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the
AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The
performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%,
indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents
causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios
demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely
matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model
in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.

Abstract: We describe a thermodynamic-inspired computing paradigm based on oscillatory
neural networks (ONNs). While ONNs have been widely studied as Ising machines
for tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems, this work
investigates their feasibility in solving linear algebra problems, specifically
the inverse matrix. Grounded in thermodynamic principles, we analytically
demonstrate that the linear approximation of the coupled Kuramoto oscillator
model leads to the inverse matrix solution. Numerical simulations validate the
theoretical framework, and we examine the parameter regimes that computation
has the highest accuracy.

Motivation: 为了解决现有空间分解技术在发展中国家可持续发展和灾害风险减少中的局限性，特别是与本地人口普查数据的差异和模型不确定性问题。

Method: 提出了Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4)，一种结合本地人口普查统计数据和卫星图像模式的多任务学习深度学习方法。

Result: 与GEM和METEOR相比，DeepC4显著提升了卢旺达城市形态地图的质量，特别是在建筑暴露和物理脆弱性方面。

Conclusion: DeepC4为大规模空间信息审计提供了一种新的深度学习方法，有助于实现2030年全球框架的目标。

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster
risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the
Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM)
Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines
(METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to
generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from
various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built
environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy
with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties
remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems,
specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore,
we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel
deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local
census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple
conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns
of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced
the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure
and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the
2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in
2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards
a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large
scales.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法主要关注垂直结构分析，缺乏有效的横向比较可视化方法。

Method: VAR结合热图和散点图，帮助开发者比较模型。

Result: VAR能帮助开发者找到特定条件下的最优模型，并理解Rashomon集合的整体特性。

Conclusion: VAR为机器学习模型的横向比较提供了有效的可视化工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models
under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of
machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML
models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but
different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on
vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding
features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack
of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models
with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses
visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This
solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With
the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under
specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall
characteristics.

Motivation: 解决差分隐私优化中全局固定参数导致隐私预算浪费或模型性能下降的问题。

Result: 在多个模型上实现困惑度降低1.3-30.5%，下游任务性能提升5.6%，梯度更新预算节省71%。

Conclusion: RLDP在保证相同隐私保护水平的同时，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining
bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained
on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic
gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a
pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,
degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been
proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control
knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization
landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy
budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay
within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP
optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep
reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the
learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter
gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian
noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language
model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget
where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation
experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers
perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream
utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of
the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same
($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility
to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地从复杂数据中提取出简单实用的分类规则，为单调矩阵的分类提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖于先验定义的几何规则，限制了细胞分裂平面定位的研究，因此需要一种数据驱动的方法来更全面地理解这一过程。

Method: 采用基于图像的细胞表示方法，使用改进的UNet架构从母细胞几何形状中学习和预测分裂模式。

Result: 模型在合成数据和拟南芥胚胎细胞上表现良好，能够解释传统几何规则无法处理的分裂模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习在理解细胞分裂模式和生成新假设方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role
in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the
positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various
geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has
relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions
under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a
fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative,
we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell
geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural
network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting
an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be
learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture
modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo
cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell
shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for
embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing
geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand
cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell
division positioning.

Conclusion: H2Tune有效解决了HHFFT中的异构性问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation
models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored
scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and
downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant
challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different
large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource
limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter
aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared
parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot
ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address
these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning
with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key
components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden
dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices,
with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided
matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and
representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge
disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local
model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves
a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method
achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在转导学习中有效解决了先验概率偏移问题。

Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike
in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling
are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive
learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset
shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose
a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing
model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior
probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal
learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised
directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be
applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on
performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide
experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Result: 在61量子位的门控量子计算机上实现了最大的PQK应用，分类性能优于经典机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 量子计算在数据受限的CAR T细胞设计问题中表现出潜力，特别是在信息较少的情况下。

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize
and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells
bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation.
These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the
intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling
components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell
phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on
libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial
space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained,
poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all
possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum
Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical
data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to
measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we
demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the
classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for
CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for
specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was
lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in
data-constrained problems.

Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material
stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data
evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various
process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material
stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy.
However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to
changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we
introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the
process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian
Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models
to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties
contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments
while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the
requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are
considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We
evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Conclusion: 该方法为从复杂神经网络中提取可解释模型提供了实用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic
formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However,
this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard
networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity
student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address
this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we
introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the
``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also
inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our
method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each
problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an
average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation
pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work
presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the
fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

Result: 提出的混淆矩阵估计方法在医学图像分布偏移下可靠预测了临床相关计数指标，但也揭示了当前性能估计技术的重要缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医学AI模型的后市场监控中，需要更深入理解真实部署环境以改进性能监控技术。

Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image
classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically
unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model
performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods
address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy.
Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate
the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where
strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are
twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction
methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark
their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well
as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix
estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on
medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift
scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation
techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment
contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for
postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are
gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in
quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models
(\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such
as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data,
such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a
fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable
models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined
through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those
used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However,
designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined
quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation
step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum
information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map
provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we
introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an
iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence
lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing
log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we
present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a
\textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained
with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms
larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a
40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly
popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress,
they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows
and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may
encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement,
and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in
scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this
paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF
training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a
parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient
orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single
centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that
adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing
hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable
training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat
product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that
G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid
foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned
models.

as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how
informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained

Method: 提出一种反向传播修改方法，提取隐式线性模型的决策边界。

Result: 成功提取了高分辨率、目标特定的特征，表明神经网络依赖可解释模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果对知识发现和可信AI系统发展有深远意义。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we
can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we
can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with
certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients
(called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific
features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular
ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural
networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be
recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for
knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

TL;DR: PAF-Net提出了一种频率解耦的时间序列预测框架，解决了多流程制造中的时间滞后、操作重叠和频段依赖问题，实验表明其性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多流程制造中的质量预测面临时间滞后、操作重叠和频段依赖三大挑战，需要一种有效的解决方案。

Method: PAF-Net采用相位相关对齐、频率独立补丁注意力和频率解耦交叉注意力模块，结合DCT分解。

Result: 在4个真实数据集上，PAF-Net的MSE和MAE分别比基线低7.06%和3.88%。

Conclusion: PAF-Net通过频率解耦和注意力机制，显著提升了多流程制造中的质量预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for
industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged
process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and
inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we
propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with
three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by
frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving
temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism
paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture
heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency
decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant
frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared
bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority.
It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88%
lower MAE. Our code is available at

TL;DR: RLVMR框架通过引入过程级监督和元推理行为奖励，解决了强化学习中低效探索的问题，提升了推理质量和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法仅优化最终任务成功率，导致推理路径低效且泛化能力差。

Method: RLVMR结合密集的过程级监督和程序化奖励，优化元推理行为，使用无评论家的策略梯度方法。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld基准测试中，RLVMR达到83.6%的成功率，推理质量显著提升。

Conclusion: RLVMR通过改进推理质量，实现了更鲁棒、高效和可解释的智能体。

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a
central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical
limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final
task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem
we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail
to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason
coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that
integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding
verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag
its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and
provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to
effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the
final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method.
On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new
state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on
the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem
from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant
actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and
interpretable agents.

Motivation: 传统RL方法如“面对不确定性的乐观”和“后验采样”存在局限性，论文旨在通过混合模型和量子算法突破这些限制。

Method: 基于混合探索-生成RL模型，结合经典和量子算法近似最优策略，避免传统RL范式。

Result: 量子算法在有限时间MDP中实现对数级遗憾界限，突破经典O(√T)限制；无限时间MDP中量子算法实现poly-log T遗憾，显著优于经典算法。

Conclusion: 论文展示了混合模型和量子算法在MDP学习中的优势，为RL领域提供了新的理论突破。

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统去中心化PCA方法中每个智能体需访问完整样本空间的限制，针对每个智能体仅观测部分维度的场景。

Method: 通过共享局部嵌入和添加高斯噪声，结合随机初始化的隐私保护，实现差分隐私和协作估计。

Result: 算法满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私保证，并具有明确的收敛速率，实验显示在中等隐私区间（ε∈[2,5]）表现优异。

Conclusion: D-DP-PM在隐私与效用间取得良好平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method
(D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked
multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where
each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the
challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions
through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative
estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a
central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local
embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent
privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise
additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that
explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical
analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory,
provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs
compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in
moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly,
allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while
maintaining competitive utility.

Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决模型的安全挑战。

Method: 通过线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct在事实验证任务中的内部表征。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致早期到中间层的显著表示偏移，并识别出敏感特征和不同的表征子空间。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和分层特征，为LLM的检测和控制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

Result: 研究结果表明，系统性对AI模型的要求更高，且需要根据系统性理由动态调整。

Conclusion: 结论指出，系统性是AI发展的关键，但其要求需根据具体理由灵活调整。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

Motivation: 现有代理设计无法有效整合新观察以动态更新世界模型，导致规划错误。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx表现优于现有代理。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型和分层规划显著提升了代理的规划能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Conclusion: Magentic-UI为提升AI代理的安全性和效率提供了可行路径，未来有望进一步优化人机协作。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced方法能更全面、客观地评估LLMs的能力，揭示了传统方法无法捕捉的模型行为。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询，以简化知识图谱（KGs）在制造业中的使用，并通过上下文提示技术提高查询准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在制造业数据管理中具有潜力，但非专家用户难以使用复杂的SPARQL查询。LLMs的出现为自然语言到SPARQL的自动转换提供了可能，但需解决上下文理解问题。

Method: 评估了多种策略，利用LLMs作为中介从KGs中检索信息，重点研究了Bosch Line Information System KG和I40 Core Information Model，并比较了不同上下文输入方法的效果。

Result: 研究发现，当LLMs获得适当的KG模式上下文时，其生成正确且完整查询的能力显著提升，上下文感知提示技术减少了幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 提出的技术有望通过LLMs简化复杂数据存储库的访问，支持制造业中的决策制定。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

Result: asp-fzn在ASP基准测试中表现优异，部分CASP基准测试中优于clingcon。

Conclusion: asp-fzn在ASP和CASP问题中表现有竞争力，性能优于现有求解器。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAAC在多智能体协作任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.
