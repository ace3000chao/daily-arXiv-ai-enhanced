We use network analysis techniques to\nmodel eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network\nmetrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify\ndistinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association\nwith students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network\nmetric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores,\nwhile the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively\ncorrelated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual\nstudents over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to\nexpert-level processing.

Our results show that explicit communication is more effective and\npreferred for conveying uncertainty, enhancing safety, trust, and user\nexperience. Conversely, implicit communication introduces ambiguity, especially\nwhen AV confidence is low. This research provides empirical insights into how\nuncertainty communication shapes pedestrian interpretation of AV behaviour and\noffer design guidance for external interfaces that integrate uncertainty as a\ncommunicative element."}

Here,\nwe present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless\nin-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various\nmodality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,\nincluding synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,\naccompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,\nand SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,\nincluding driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road\nconditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning\nmethods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all\nmodalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream\npublic toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource\nand accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit\nsystems."}

Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause\ncognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it\ndifficult to locate key information.

Drawing insights from a formative study on academic\nreading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented\npaper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure\nwhere each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise\nsummary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users\nto quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and\nverify summaries against the source text.

This\npaper proposes a novel task called \\textbf{A}utomatic \\textbf{D}ictionary\n\\textbf{S}election (\\textbf{ADS}).

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains.

To address this, we introduce\nKolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes\n(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse\nspline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction.

This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL).

Drawing insights from a formative study on academic\nreading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented\npaper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure\nwhere each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise\nsummary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users\nto quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and\nverify summaries against the source text.

Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned\nembedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some\nattributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we\nestablish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable\nRefinement (CGIR) model.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths\nand considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,\naiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions."}

As a result, established platforms in other\ndomains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to\nengage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of\nthese experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI\ninnovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms\nactively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new\nchallenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video\nexperience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences\nintroduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when\noptimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These\nissues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make\nit difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the\nchallenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present\nour experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it\ncan be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned\nmultimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach\ndemonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning\nmethods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform."}

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope\nour method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further\nprogress, we will release code and dataset."}

This work\nexplores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements\nusing Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a\nlow-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of\nGENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical\ntool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional\noperators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.\nLeveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to\ntraditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known\nalgebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'\nactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map\nreconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse\nsampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive\nperformance compared to established methods.

This\ncombined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an\nLP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used\nby existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables\nSILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by\ntraditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective\noracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing\nDeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the\nunderlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the\ncommon false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in\ntraditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for\nproactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their\necosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior."}

Our approach decomposes the problem into\ntwo hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets\nwithin explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner\nprioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating\nmacro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear\nprogramming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the\nmethod efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures\nrigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying\nsizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic\nalgorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and\nconsistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows."}
