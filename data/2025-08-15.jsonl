Unfortunately, under-represented groups often have lower\nincoming spatial ability. Courses that improve spatial skills exist but are not\nwidely used. Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested as a possible tool for\nteaching spatial reasoning since students are more accurate and complete\nspatial tasks more quickly in three dimensions. However, no prior work has\ndeveloped or evaluated a fully-structured VR spatial skills course. Objectives:\nWe seek to assess the effectiveness of teaching spatial reasoning in VR, both\nin isolation as a structured training curriculum and also in comparison to\ntraditional methods. Methods: We adapted three modules of an existing\npencil-and-paper course to VR, leveraging educational scaffolding and real-time\nfeedback in the design. We evaluated our three-week course in a study with\n$n=24$ undergraduate introductory STEM students, capturing both quantitative\nspatial ability gains (using pre- and post test scores on validated\nassessments) and qualitative insights (from a post-study questionnaire). We\nalso compared our VR course to an offering of a baseline non-VR course (using\ndata collected in a previous study). Results and Conclusions: Students who took\nour VR course had significant spatial ability gains. Critically, we find no\nsignificant difference in outcomes between our VR course (3 meetings of 120\nminutes each) and a baseline pencil and paper course (10 meetings of 90 minutes\neach), suggesting that spatial reasoning can be very efficiently taught in VR.\nWe observed cybersickness at lower rates than are generally reported and most\nstudents reported enjoying learning in VR."}

There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and\naccuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,\nTemporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on\npublic data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show\nthat ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or\neven improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,\nthe main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of\nforecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems."}

Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding.

This visual-to-neural\nmapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs\nreliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and\nsubjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis.

Mamba, a recent\nsequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.

Then, it performs an\napproximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable\nparameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,\nand MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves\ncomparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\\times$\nfewer parameters.

For every node, we construct a structured\ncontext vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,\nclustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A\nlightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation\nvector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent\nembedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural\nlanguage explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)\nguiding the GNN itself via a \"text-injection\" mechanism that feeds explanations\nback into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph\ndatasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,\nand GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive\nclassification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.\nRepository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node."}

While prior work\nhas acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it\nto data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the\ndevelopment of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models."}

We believe that these scalar rewards\nsometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency\nand personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for\npersonalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural\nlanguage feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and\nthe question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision\nsignal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and\ninternalize effective personalization strategies.

Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on\nquantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which\nbiases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility.

By\nintegrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,\nCLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.\nTo address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against\ndiverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the\nmultimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client\nsamples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and\neliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed\naligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset\nusing prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive\nexperiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in\nASR, i.e., 2.03\\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving\naverage MA by 7.92\\% and 0.48\\%, respectively."}

We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation\nis governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.\nMotivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,\n\\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this\nregularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our\nexperiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or\nimproved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead."}
