### [1] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了三种先进LLM（GPT-4o、Llama 3.1和Gemma 2）在金融沟通中标注论据质量的能力，评估了其一致性和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融论据对投资决策和公众信任至关重要，但其质量评估研究较少。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的一致性和对抗性别偏见的攻击。

Result: LLM标注比人类标注一致性更高，但仍存在性别偏见。

Conclusion: 研究为未来更可靠、经济高效且无偏见的标注方法提供了建议。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

### [2] [TurQUaz at CheckThat! 2025: Debating Large Language Models for Scientific Web Discourse Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08265)
*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的委员会辩论方法，利用多个大语言模型（LLMs）模拟学术讨论，以识别推文中的科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。委员会辩论方法在检测科学研究引用方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过模拟学术讨论的方式，提高对推文中科学内容的识别准确性。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论，最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 委员会辩论方法在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务中表现优异，但在其他任务中仍有改进空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [3] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在认知共情任务上表现优于人类，但在情感共情上显著低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣的潜力。

Method: 使用标准化心理测试比较小型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在认知和情感共情上的表现。

Result: LLMs在认知共情上优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言模型在提供认知共情方面潜力巨大，但情感共情能力有限，适合提供客观一致的情感支持。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

### [4] [Real-time News Story Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08272)
*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于将新闻文章动态分配到特定故事中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻阅读体验，通过自动将新闻文章归类到特定故事中，帮助用户更好地跟踪事件发展。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream和TextClust），提取特定事件和命名实体以实现故事识别。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体数据集上验证，结果表明该方法能生成合理的故事分类结果，并通过人工评估。

Conclusion: 提出的实时故事识别方法有效，适用于新闻监控系统。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

### [5] [TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08273)
*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TT-XAI是一个轻量级框架，通过关键词提取和LLM推理提升临床语言模型的分类性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床语言模型在处理长文本电子健康记录时预测和解释不可靠的问题。

Method: 1. 从出院记录中提取关键词以提升BERT分类性能；2. 使用关键词引导的LLM生成临床解释。

Result: 关键词增强方法在机器和人类可解释性上均表现更优。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展的、可信赖的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

### [6] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种透明的方法（SCBM），利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合LLMs和轻量级分类器，在多种语言和平台的仇恨与反仇恨言论识别中表现优异，同时具备高解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增加对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要自动化的检测方法，且现有黑盒模型缺乏透明性。

Method: 提出SCBM模型，利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，通过LLMs将文本映射到形容词表示，再用轻量级分类器进行任务处理。

Result: 在五个多语言和平台的数据集上，SCBM平均macro-F1为0.69，优于现有方法，且融合形容词表示后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词表示是一种紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方法，适用于仇恨与反仇恨言论识别，并可推广至其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

### [7] [MLLM-CBench:A Comprehensive Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning of Multimodal LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275)
*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型持续指令调优的基准，包含多维评估、算法比较和任务设计，发现模型能力、任务顺序和算法选择对持续学习效果有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型持续指令调优领域缺乏系统性评估基准的问题。

Method: 提出MLLM-CTBench基准，结合答案准确性和推理质量评估，比较八种持续学习算法和两种训练范式，并使用16个数据集覆盖六个领域。

Result: 发现模型能力、推理链退化速度、算法依赖性和KL约束在强化学习中的重要性。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严格标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

### [8] [Evaluating Contrast Localizer for Identifying Causal Unitsin Social & Mathematical Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08276)
*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过对比定位器在大语言模型和视觉语言模型中定位与心理理论和数学推理任务相关的因果单元，发现低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，质疑了对比定位器的因果相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在大语言模型和视觉语言模型中，如何通过对比定位器准确识别与心理理论和数学推理任务相关的因果单元。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用，比较功能选择单元、低激活单元和随机选择单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器衍生的单元对心理理论任务的损害更大。

Conclusion: 研究质疑对比定位器的因果相关性，建议使用更广泛的刺激集和更准确的任务特定单元定位方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

### [9] [Objective Metrics for Evaluating Large Language Models Using External Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08277)
*Haoze Du,Richard Li,Edward Gehringer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用主观指标评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，强调自动化、透明度和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主观评估方法的局限性，提供一致、可重复且偏差最小化的性能评估。

Method: 利用文本材料、基准测试和结构化评估流程，减少对人工解释的依赖。

Result: 实现了对LLM输出的客观、可扩展评估，适用于教育、科学等高要求领域。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM性能评估提供了高效、透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

### [10] [MinionsLLM: a Task-adaptive Framework For The Training and Control of Multi-Agent Systems Through Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08283)
*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM框架结合LLMs、行为树和形式语法，实现多智能体系统的自然语言控制，并通过两种数据集生成方法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中自然语言控制的挑战，提供标准化接口和优化方法。

Method: 集成LLMs与行为树和形式语法，提出两种数据集生成方法（Method A和B）优化模型。

Result: Method B将语法有效性提升至92.6%，任务性能平均提高33%，小模型优化效果显著。

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为资源受限场景提供高效解决方案，框架开源以促进研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出ROUGE作为幻觉检测评估指标存在误导性，提出需采用语义感知的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题影响可靠性，现有评估指标ROUGE与人类判断不一致。

Method: 通过人类研究和LLM-as-Judge等新指标，对比ROUGE与人类评估结果。

Result: ROUGE召回率高但精度极低，部分检测方法性能下降45.9%；简单启发式方法可与复杂技术媲美。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确衡量幻觉检测性能，确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

### [12] [Sacred or Synthetic? Evaluating LLM Reliability and Abstention for Religious Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08287)
*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为FiqhQA的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在伊斯兰教法学领域的准确性和可靠性，特别关注四大逊尼派学派。实验显示GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，而Gemini和Fanar在避免错误回答方面更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多个领域被广泛使用，但其在宗教领域的可靠性和准确性尚未得到充分研究，尤其是伊斯兰教法学领域。

Method: 研究引入了FiqhQA基准，评估LLM在生成伊斯兰教法学裁决时的准确性及其避免回答的能力，支持阿拉伯语和英语。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，但Gemini和Fanar在避免错误回答方面更优。所有模型在阿拉伯语中的表现均下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在宗教应用中需谨慎部署LLM，并进行任务特定评估的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

### [13] [Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08292)
*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Putnam-AXIOM是一个新的数学推理基准，包含522个大学竞赛题目和100个变体，用于评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力，避免训练数据污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准已接近饱和且易受训练数据污染影响，需要动态、抗污染的评估框架。

Method: 引入Putnam-AXIOM基准及其变体集，通过扰动变量生成无限流的新实例，并使用Teacher-Forced Accuracy（TFA）评估推理过程。

Result: OpenAI的o1-preview模型在原始集上得分为41.9%，但在变体集上下降19.6%，其他模型也表现类似趋势，显示记忆化问题。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM提供了一个严格的、抗污染的评估框架，强调动态基准的必要性。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE框架通过Chain-of-Thought数据增强优化LLMs在教育场景中的表现，提升教学指导和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现成LLMs在教育中表现不佳的问题，如过早揭示答案、缺乏适应性及易受情绪操控。

Method: 收集学生与ChatGPT的对话，用CoT提示增强数据，设计针对性案例优化模型。

Result: 经过CoDAE微调的模型在教学指导、推理支持和抗干扰方面表现更优。

Conclusion: CoDAE显著提升了LLMs在教育场景中的适用性和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mol-R1框架通过PRID和MoIA策略提升长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）中表现有限且效率低，Mol-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用PRID策略生成高质量推理数据集，并通过MoIA策略（结合SFT和RPO）优化模型推理能力。

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1显著提升了长链思维推理模型在分子生成任务中的解释性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

Method: 选择泰卢固语、印地语和英语进行实验，评估标记化训练、微调及下游任务表现，重点关注形态对齐和标记化质量。

Result: 形态对齐对句法任务（如词性标注、命名实体识别）有中等正面影响，但标记化算法（如Unigram）对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对性能有中等影响，但标记化算法的选择更为关键，特别是在复杂形态语言中。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: 提出了两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入边际目标和选择性更新机制，提升小型LLM在性能差距下的对齐能力。APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench中表现优异。

Motivation: 小型LLM在性能差距下难以对齐人类偏好，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero两种方法，结合边际目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中提升胜率2.0点，长度控制胜率1.4点；在MT-Bench中表现优异，尤其在STEM和人文任务中。

Conclusion: 简单修改偏好目标可显著提升小型LLM的对齐效果，为资源受限场景提供实用方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

TL;DR: 论文通过物理学方法研究大型语言模型在推理过程中隐藏状态的变化，发现一种类似能量的量几乎保持不变，并提出了一种控制方法Jacobian steering。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型隐藏状态的变化规律，以提升模型的可解释性和可控性。

Method: 结合隐藏状态变化率和模型的下一个token确定性，提出能量守恒概念，并推导出Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 随机权重模型比预训练模型更严格地保持能量守恒，Jacobian steering在测试模型中表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过物理学视角分析模型，为可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法捕捉多样化的用户偏好。本文旨在通过多元化对齐方法解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于少样本比较回归的可引导多元化模型，利用上下文学习和细粒度属性比较响应选项。

Result: 该方法在Moral Integrity Corpus和HelpSteer2数据集上表现优异，优于多种基线方法和最先进方法。

Conclusion: 本文为多元化对齐提供了新见解和研究方向，推动了伦理AI的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Motivation: 开发一种通用的高质量令牌压缩方法，以减少计算和存储开销，同时保持下游任务的性能。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪学习生成压缩表示，并对编码器进行小幅度修改以优化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩时性能接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能略有下降，适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景下具有显著优势，未来可进一步扩展其适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏高质量数据集，阻碍了应用发展。

Method: 引入DepressLLM，基于3,699篇自传体叙事训练，采用SToPS模块提供可解释预测。

Result: AUC达0.789，高置信度样本提升至0.904，验证了在异质数据中的有效性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有望助力抑郁症早期诊断，为精神病学AI应用提供方向。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: 针对RAG系统在理解和生成地道粤语口语表达时面临的标注数据不足和语言变异性问题，研究旨在通过PEFT方法提升其性能。

Method: 评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，对比了不同PEFT方法在检索和生成准确性上的表现，并分析了有限数据下的领域适应策略。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA方法显著减少了可训练参数，同时保持了检索和生成质量，但在保留语言细节和适应性上仍有局限。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在领域特定语言任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Motivation: 现实世界的推理场景需要处理多样化和复杂的环境，而现有强化学习研究多局限于特定领域任务，无法全面覆盖。

Method: 提出InternBootcamp框架，支持自动化生成多样化任务案例和集成验证模块，并通过自动化代理工作流加速开发。

Result: 前沿模型在许多推理任务中表现不佳，但使用InternBootcamp训练能显著提升性能，32B模型在Bootcamp-EVAL和其他基准测试中达到最优。

Conclusion: 任务规模的扩展（task scaling）是提升推理能力的有效途径，InternBootcamp为通用推理模型的发展提供了基础设施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Motivation: 现有移动代理方法仅关注显式意图流（如步骤序列），忽视隐式意图流（如个人偏好），难以构建个性化代理。

Method: 收集MobileIAR数据集，提出IFRAgent框架，结合显式意图流构建标准操作程序库，隐式意图流构建用户习惯库，并利用检索增强生成和查询重写生成个性化查询。

Result: IFRAgent在意图对齐率和步骤完成率上分别平均提升6.79%和5.30%，相对改进为32.06%和26.34%。

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过显式和隐式意图流的结合，显著提升了移动代理与人类意图的对齐效果。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLMs在微调和上下文学习中的翻译性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了一种有效的数据生成方法，提升了LLMs的性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Motivation: 现有方法在激发LLMs表现人类特质时存在浅层和不稳定的问题，无法精确且一致地体现目标特质。

Result: 实验表明，IROTE能在多种任务中稳定激发LLMs的目标特质表现，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: IROTE通过优化的自我反思文本，实现了LLMs对人类特质的稳定和可迁移表现，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Magical优于现有方法，并减少31.66%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical为异构数据下的MLLG任务提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Motivation: 科学文献问答是推动新科学发现的关键步骤，但目前对两阶段RAG-LLMs框架中重排序器的潜力和局限性缺乏深入探索。

Method: 开发了SciRerankBench基准测试，包含三种类型的Q-C-A对（噪声上下文、语义相似但逻辑无关上下文、反事实上下文），并在五个科学领域评估了13种重排序器的性能。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门针对RAG-LLMs中重排序器的基准测试，为未来研究提供了有价值的指导和观察。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core

annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出ARoG框架，解决在隐私保护的RAG场景中匿名实体检索的挑战，通过关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在幻觉和知识过时问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如KGs）解决这些问题。但私有KGs在RAG中使用时存在隐私风险，尤其是匿名实体导致语义丢失，传统RAG无法有效检索。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含两种策略：(1) 关系中心抽象，将匿名实体转化为可检索的高层概念；(2) 结构导向抽象，将自然语言问题转化为结构化抽象路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG在性能和隐私鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: ARoG框架成功解决了匿名实体检索的挑战，同时严格保护隐私，为隐私保护的RAG系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在工具使用方面效率不足，缺乏稳定的训练环境和可验证的奖励机制。

Method: 设计了自动化环境构建流程（包括场景分解、文档生成等）和可验证奖励机制，结合标准强化学习算法进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的工具使用能力，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过改进上下文理解和推理能力，该方法为工具使用提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出TiMoE模型，通过时间分段的预训练和因果路由解决LLMs知识过时问题，减少未来信息泄漏，并在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型因训练数据固定导致知识过时和预测时可能依赖未来信息的问题。

Method: 预训练一组GPT风格的专家模型，分别针对不同时间段的数据，并通过TiMoE（时间感知的专家混合）在推理时屏蔽未来时间段的专家，合并剩余专家的预测。

Result: TiMoE在8个标准NLP任务和TSQA基准测试中表现优异，减少未来知识错误达15%。

Conclusion: 模块化、时间分段的预训练结合因果路由是保持LLMs时间有效性的简单有效方法，同时不牺牲通用性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

Motivation: 传统方法无法全面评估LLMs的数学推理能力，需要更准确的鲁棒性测试方法。

Method: 通过数学等价但语言和参数变化的题目（PutnamGAP数据集）对LLMs进行压力测试。

Result: 18个商业和开源模型在变体题目上表现显著下降，如O3在核心变体上下降10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性问题，为改进其数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型应用广泛，但其编码和再现意识形态偏见（尤其是政治和经济维度）的问题仍受关注。

Method: 基于政治罗盘测试（PCT），使用对比对提取和比较模型（如Mistral和DeepSeek）的隐藏层激活，并提出分层分析流程。

Result: 发现解码器LLM在各层系统性编码表征偏见，可通过导向向量有效缓解。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM中政治偏见的编码机制，并提供了一种超越表面干预的去偏见方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Conclusion: BiasGym为LLMs的偏见分析和缓解提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Motivation: 减少资深医生在放射科报告QA评分中的劳动成本，并解决人工评分可能存在的偏差和不准确问题。

Method: Sqator通过分析初级和资深报告之间的修订文本片段，衡量其重要性并合并分数，实现自动评分。

Result: 在12,013份放射科报告上的实验表明，Sqator能提供与人工评分竞争的结果，且修订片段的重要性评分与资深医生判断一致。

Conclusion: Sqator是一种有效的自动QA评分工具，能够替代人工评分并减少成本。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Conclusion: 为未来减轻文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解能力奠定基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Result: 在多个任务上验证，ASPD平均提速1.85倍，最高3.19倍，且生成质量差异小于1%。

Conclusion: ASPD为高效LLM并行推理设定了新基准，适用于延迟敏感场景。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

Result: 在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得最佳成绩，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 弱监督与微调结合能有效克服数据稀缺问题，为低资源、方言丰富的语言提供高质量的ASR解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Motivation: 评估语言模型在多语言环境下的多步推理能力，尤其是低资源语言（如孟加拉语）的表现。

Method: 使用手动翻译的孟加拉语数据集，对比英语和多语言模型在原始和翻译版本上的表现。

Result: 推理上下文对非二元问题有益，但模型在利用孟加拉语推理步骤时效果较差。

Conclusion: 推理步骤对模型预测有贡献，但表现因模型和语言而异。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定长度的训练预算，未能利用学习过程中从探索到压缩的自然进展，限制了推理能力的优化。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)，逐步收紧令牌预算，并设计奖励函数平衡任务正确性、长度效率和格式遵循。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法在相同最终预算下优于固定预算基线，实现了更高的准确性和显著提升的令牌效率。

Conclusion: 渐进约束作为训练高效推理模型的强大归纳偏置，验证了课程学习策略的有效性。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）表现优异，但其幻觉问题严重影响了可信度。现有方法在直接对齐令牌生成与归因生成方面存在局限性。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1)用特定令牌标识标记文档并利用其逻辑估计文档对答案的贡献；(2)将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多个指标上显著优于现有最先进模型，且延迟低、鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: LoDIT在提升模型可信度方面表现出色，同时兼顾效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文任务中KV缓存的内存和延迟问题，以及累积注意力误差。

Method: 引入RetroAttention技术，通过轻量级输出缓存修正过去的注意力输出。

Result: 在长生成任务中，RetroAttention显著提升KV暴露和准确性。

Conclusion: RetroAttention突破了固定注意力输出范式，有效提升长上下文任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用LLM于患者治疗场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者培训治疗师。治疗行为缺乏绝对标准，但常见错误可识别并作为反馈依据。

Method: 建立错误行为指南和纠正策略，构建人机交互对话反馈数据集（MATE），通过微调生成监督模型用于治疗师培训。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈，适用于治疗师培训。

Conclusion: 该方法为治疗师培训提供了一种有效且安全的解决方案，展示了LLM在临床培训中的潜力。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Motivation: LLM的推理过程因自回归特性难以加速，现有方法多依赖额外训练，READER旨在无需训练的情况下提升效率。

Method: READER结合自重复文本和统计搜索扩展推测解码树，优化KV缓存大小，适用于大批量任务。

Result: READER在无需训练的情况下，速度提升超过40%，在检索增强生成任务中实现10倍加速。

Conclusion: READER为LLM推理提供高效、无损的解决方案，特别适合工业应用中的大批量场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务中面临评估标准模糊和奖励信号不稳定的问题，受人类评估启发，提出比较性评估方法。

Method: 提出CPO方法，从样本评分转向组间比较评分，并设计CharacterArena框架，包含多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估。

Result: 在CharacterEval、CharacterBench和CharacterArena上的实验表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena通过比较性评估解决了主观任务中的奖励建模问题，为强化学习在开放任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种融合所有中间层的多语言LLM架构，显著提升低资源语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在低资源语言上性能下降的问题，避免仅使用最终编码层的信息损失。

Method: 采用全局Softmax权重和Transformer Softmax模型，融合所有中间层信息并映射到LLM嵌入空间。

Result: 在XNLI等任务中显著优于基线，低资源语言性能提升明显，如Sinhala分类准确率从71.66%升至75.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、可扩展的多语言LLM提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过领域适配和增强推理能力，可以将先进的CDCR模型有效应用于流程工业，提升数据质量和日志记录的关联性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Result: AutoCodeBench包含3,920个问题，覆盖20种语言，测试显示先进LLMs仍难以应对其复杂性和多样性。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为社区提供了评估多语言代码生成能力的新资源，推动更实用和挑战性任务的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

TL;DR: OdysseyBench是一个评估LLM代理在长期工作流程中的表现的基准测试，包含真实用例和新合成的复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注独立任务，无法反映现实场景中的长期依赖和多交互协调需求。

Method: 提出OdysseyBench和HomerAgents框架，通过自动化生成长期工作流程任务。

Result: OdysseyBench能更准确地评估LLM代理在复杂场景中的能力。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench是推动LLM代理在现实生产力场景中发展的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑丰富的指令跟随任务中的表现，提出了自动化框架LogicIFGen和基准LogicIFEval，发现当前LLMs在此类任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，自然语言指令中的逻辑结构变得复杂，但LLMs在此类逻辑丰富指令上的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证的指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准，包含426条逻辑丰富的指令。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，仅能正确跟随不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑丰富的指令跟随任务中存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在解码过程中存在的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃了丰富的中间预测，而研究发现正确结果常出现在中间步骤，但被后续去噪步骤覆盖。

Method: 1) 时间自一致性投票：训练无关的解码策略，聚合去噪步骤的预测；2) 时间一致性强化：使用时间语义熵（TSE）作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用负TSE奖励即可在Countdown数据集上提升24.7%，结合准确性奖励后，在多个数据集上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了dLLMs中时间动态的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用它们。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

*Ryan Mioduski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在将17-18世纪弗吉尼亚土地专利描述转换为地理坐标中的表现，发现某些模型在准确性和成本效益上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统土地专利描述为叙述性文本，限制了空间分析，因此需要一种高效、准确的方法将其转换为地理坐标。

Method: 使用六种OpenAI模型，在两种范式（直接转换和工具增强链式思考）下测试，并与GIS分析师等基线方法比较。

Result: 最佳模型平均误差23公里，优于传统方法；成本效益高的模型（gpt-4o-2024-08-06）每1000份专利成本1.09美元。

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理参考中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical
multimodal research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分散式联邦学习（DFL）在边缘计算系统中面临通信瓶颈、资源异构性和数据异构性等挑战，影响模型性能和能源效率。

Method: 将拓扑构建建模为双优化问题，设计两阶段算法动态优化通信拓扑，并引入重要性感知模型聚合机制。

Result: Hat-DFed框架在复杂边缘环境中有效提升了模型性能并降低了累积能耗。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的分散式联邦学习提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

TL;DR: XFMNet是一种多模态融合网络，用于解决多站点水质预测中的时空动态建模问题，通过结合遥感降水图像提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变而具有挑战性，多站点场景进一步增加了时空动态建模的难度。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应降采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解分离趋势和周期成分，并通过跨注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空模式。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，XFMNet显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: XFMNet通过逐步递归融合，有效捕捉长期趋势和短期波动，提升了时空分布时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Motivation: 解决深度学习中训练和测试数据分布不同（域偏移）导致的性能下降问题，特别是在时间序列数据中。

Result: 在六个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和对比模块，显著提升了域自适应性能，适用于时间序列分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信行业仍依赖人工干预，现有研究多关注时空相关性，但忽略了流量突发性和概念漂移对预测的影响。

Method: MGSTC将历史数据分块，结合粗粒度时间注意力和细粒度空间注意力，实现多粒度特征互补，并采用在线学习策略实时检测概念漂移。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，MGSTC优于11种现有方法。

Conclusion: MGSTC能够高效处理连续预测任务，提升预测精度。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Result: 提出了容量定理、误差传播分析和生物学学习规则的见解，表明注意力头可存储O($\sqrt{d_k}$)关联。

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能源于生物学优化的计算原理，而非仅架构创新。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Conclusion: 该方法整合了场景上下文信息，捕捉材料光谱变化，并提供可解释的概率度量，适用于遥感辐射测量。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

TL;DR: 论文提出HSA-Net框架，通过分层特征投影和融合解决GNN的过平滑问题，结合交叉注意力和Graph-Mamba投影器，显著提升分子表示学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在深度层存在过平滑问题，现有方法难以兼顾全局和局部特征，因此探索Mamba作为投影器，并提出HSA-Net框架以解决全局-局部权衡问题。

Method: HSA-Net包含两个模块：分层自适应投影器（HAP）动态选择交叉注意力或Graph-Mamba投影器处理不同层特征；源感知融合（SAF）模块自适应融合多级特征。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层和结构感知设计，有效解决了GNN的过平滑问题，提升了分子表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL是一种结合分层联邦学习和分割学习的新方法，通过中间层表示学习减少通信开销和协调复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中设备计算异构性、资源限制设备负担重、通信成本高和模型聚合复杂的问题。

Method: 整合分割学习和分层模型聚合，引入中间层表示学习，使客户端和边缘服务器独立计算训练目标。

Result: 在图像分类和分割任务中，SHeRL-FL比集中式联邦学习和分层联邦学习减少90%数据传输，比SplitFed减少50%。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL显著降低了通信开销和协调复杂性，提升了分层分割学习方法的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊模式的Tsetlin机（FPTM），通过模糊化子句评估策略，显著减少了所需的子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Tsetlin机（TM）采用“全有或全无”的子句评估策略，导致需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确性。FPTM通过模糊化评估策略，解决了这一问题。

Method: FPTM引入模糊子句评估机制，允许部分子句中的字面量失败时，其余字面量仍能按比例贡献投票，从而更灵活、高效地匹配模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM显著减少了子句数量和内存占用，训练速度提升高达316倍，同时准确性优于传统TM和其他方法。

Conclusion: FPTM通过模糊化子句评估策略，实现了高效、灵活的模式匹配，适用于在线学习和资源受限的环境。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理出发，证明了缩放点积注意力（SDPA）机制的正向传播是退化单边熵最优传输（EOT）问题的精确解，反向传播的梯度与强化学习中的优势策略梯度相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为SDPA机制提供数学上的严格证明，揭示其正向传播和反向传播的优化本质。

Method: 将SDPA的正向传播建模为EOT问题，反向传播的梯度与优势策略梯度等价，并分析其信息几何特性。

Result: 证明了SDPA的正向传播是EOT问题的解，反向传播梯度与优势策略梯度一致，揭示了其信息几何特性。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种基于优化原理的机制，正向传播实现最优推断，反向传播实现合理的流形感知学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合离线数据的在线线性赌博机算法OOPE，显著降低了在线遗憾，并通过理论分析证明了其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用（如推荐系统、在线广告）拥有大量离线数据，如何有效利用这些数据减少在线遗憾是一个重要问题。

Method: OOPE算法在探索阶段使用扩展的D-optimal设计，结合离线数据优化在线表现。

Result: 算法在线遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$，并首次给出了依赖离线数据质量的最小最大遗憾下界。

Conclusion: OOPE在离线数据质量不同情况下均表现最优，并通过近似方法进一步优化了高维问题中的性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Result: FWPs展示了动态权重变化的优势，并与Transformer和状态空间模型有联系，同时与大脑突触可塑性模型相似。

Conclusion: FWPs为自然与人工智能的融合提供了新视角，具有潜在的研究和应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统（如生物网络）常违反传统因果发现算法的假设（所有变量可观测且因果图无环），现有方法在处理混杂因素时存在线性假设或可扩展性问题。

Method: DCCD-CONF通过交替优化图结构和估计混杂因素分布（最大化数据对数似然）来学习因果图。

Result: 在合成数据和真实基因扰动数据集上，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因素识别方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF不仅表现优异，还提供了理论一致性保证，适用于复杂现实系统。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释更真实且忠实于模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer为异构图解释提供了更有效的解决方案，提升了模型透明度和解释质量。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）要求输入测度质量相等，而部分最优传输（POT）放宽了这一限制，但现有POT求解器依赖熵正则化，导致传输计划密集，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种二次正则化的POT（QPOT）方法，通过二次正则化诱导稀疏传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据、CIFAR-10数据集及实际应用（如颜色迁移和领域适应）中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为需要稀疏传输计划的应用提供了一种有效的替代方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Result: 在相同时间预算下，该方法比同步SGD更快且精度相当或更高。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种异构环境，如云平台和高性能计算集群。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Conclusion: UQGNN通过创新设计有效解决了多变量时空预测中的不确定性和相关性挑战。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: 实验表明，SHEFL显著提高了公平性和整体性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHEFL有效解决了计算异构性问题，为联邦学习在多样化客户端场景中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Conclusion: 动态秩训练框架有效解决了低秩训练的局限性，适用于多种神经网络任务。

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Motivation: 针对专业语义分类任务中需要专家标注和高推理吞吐量的需求，传统方法成本高且效率低，因此需要一种更高效的微调策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业分类任务提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中显著提升了性能，平衡了稳定性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GWM和多级协作蒸馏，有效提升了OCIL模型的性能，适用于不同内存预算。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: COGS方法有效提升了TSP求解器的分布鲁棒性，为实际物流问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Result: RF模型在多步和一步生成中均表现出多项式离散化复杂度，优于VP和VE模型。

Conclusion: 本文首次从理论上解释了RF模型在多步和一步生成中的优越性能。

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiFac通过差异化因子一致性和辅助信息源，有效提升了半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的技术，能够提升告警关系学习的准确性和速度。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Result: 在8个真实数据集上，WaveTS系列模型以更少参数实现SOTA性能，WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型在轻量化和性能上均优于现有方法，特别适合多通道时间序列预测。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

Result: 实验表明Oblivionis在遗忘效果与模型性能间取得平衡，优于本地训练。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的隐私合规提供了有效解决方案，并指明未来发展方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Result: 在二元和多类分类任务中，该方法在准确率和稀疏度上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 遗传算法是识别强彩票子网络的有效方法，同时强调了在复杂网络架构中评估指标的重要性。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Method: 采用优化技术，研究可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）如何适应复杂先验分布，并解决可识别性、损失构造和对称性等学习挑战。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐层的BNNs配备灵活的可训练激活函数，也能有效实现目标函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 通过优化激活函数，BNNs能够有效实现复杂的函数空间先验，为模型性能提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Result: 实验表明APRNet在时间序列预测任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位，显著提升了模型捕捉时变模式的能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果不足。

Conclusion: 阶段转移攻击对持续学习模型构成严重威胁，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN是一种简洁有效的架构改进，适用于复杂科学和工程问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Result: 在多组真实数据集上显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理约束，有效提升了无传感器区域的交通预测能力。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在转导和归纳顶点分类任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态相互作用和势能场优化，显著提升了顶点分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有重要价值，未来需进一步探索。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Motivation: 注意力机制在Transformer架构中起核心作用，但其权重虽不直接决定模型输出，却能反映令牌间的交互模式。研究旨在利用这些信息丰富模型解释性。

Method: 开发了两种新方法：1）将注意力权重整合到Shapley值分解中，用于局部解释；2）将注意力权重与概念激活向量结合，用于全局解释。

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重能有效融入可解释AI框架，提升Transformer模型的解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重可作为补充信息，增强现有解释方法，为模型行为提供更全面的理解。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Conclusion: 仿真实验验证了所提策略在真实数据集上的优越性，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet

strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from

efficiency.

Motivation: 现实世界中的关系数据（如社交网络或生物模型）通常不完整，目前缺乏对最佳预测方法的明确指导，尤其是无节点属性的网络。

Method: 使用550个真实网络的大规模基准测试，比较了四种堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器（包括两种新方法）和两种图神经网络算法，评估了AUC和Top-k准确率。

Result: 结果显示，没有单一算法在所有网络中表现最佳，堆叠模型在AUC上优于或与图神经网络在Top-k上竞争，性能受网络特性（如度分布、三角形密度）影响。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习算法通过选择最佳算法优化预测，优于现有方法且可扩展至大型网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Conclusion: 主动测试可成功扩展至LLM评估，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

Result: 使用Chi-Geometry生成的基准数据集，设计了两款新GNN架构：一款通过全连接提高预测准确性，但计算成本高；另一款通过虚拟节点保持线性计算成本，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN手性预测提供了有效的基准测试工具，并指导了两种新架构的设计，分别解决了准确性和计算成本的问题。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

*Tianyun Yang,Yunwen Li,Ziniu Li,Zhihang Lin,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理与形式化语言的几何问题解决方法，通过混合推理轨迹和强化学习提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在几何问题解决（GPS）中因不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理而受限，需要更透明和准确的方法。

Method: 结合链式思维（CoT）与形式化语言，模型交替生成自然语言推理和可执行代码，并通过监督微调和强化学习优化。

Result: 新模型GF-Reasoner在标准GPS基准上提升15%准确率，超越同类模型，且推理轨迹更简洁。

Conclusion: 该方法通过混合推理和形式化语言显著提升几何问题解决能力，并为未来研究提供了设计选择的详细分析。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

*Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar,Yang Li,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一种通用的神经推理模型，用于处理异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，通过结合基于集合的Transformer和语义基础模块，实现跨数据集特征依赖学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常具有多样性和不连贯性（如不同模式、不一致语义和无固定特征顺序），这使得构建通用模型以跨数据集利用信息变得困难。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的Transformer（具有置换不变性）和语义基础模块（整合自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例），以学习跨数据集特征依赖关系。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，并能自然支持成本感知的主动特征获取，在测试时预算约束下选择信息丰富的特征。

Conclusion: ASPIRE为实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理迈出了一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码的分类器校准方法MaC-Cal，通过随机稀疏性提升置信度与准确性的对齐，显著改善了深度神经网络的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景中因校准不佳可能导致严重后果，现有方法多忽略欠自信问题，亟需更有效的校准方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案，结合自适应稀疏性动态调整掩码保留率，以优化置信度与准确性的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

### [124] [Topos Theory for Generative AI and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08293)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型分类生成AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造构建新的LLM架构，并证明LLM范畴是一个拓扑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用范畴论中的通用性质（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）构建新型LLM架构，以超越传统的线性或混合专家模型。

Method: 使用范畴论中的通用构造（如拉回、推出、等化子等）设计新的LLM组合结构，并通过理论验证LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴是一个拓扑（具有极限、指数对象和子对象分类器），并提出了基于反向传播函子化的潜在实现方法。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论的工具，成功构建了新型LLM架构，并验证了其理论可行性，为生成AI的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

TL;DR: 提出了拓扑因果模型（TCMs），利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象），展示了这些性质在因果推断中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用拓扑范畴的性质（如完备性和子对象分类器）来扩展因果模型的能力，以支持更复杂的因果推断任务。

Method: 定义了一类新的因果模型（TCMs），基于拓扑范畴的性质，如（共）完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象，并证明其在因果推断中的应用。

Result: 证明了TCMs的完备性，展示了如何通过（共）极限解决任意复杂因果图，并利用子对象分类器建模因果干预。

Conclusion: TCMs为因果推断提供了强大的数学工具，支持复杂因果图的建模和干预，同时具备内部逻辑表达能力。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理高度约束的多目标问题时，现代算法难以获得好的近似解，而问题实例间可能存在相似的适应度景观。

Method: 先用计算密集型多目标算法解决一个问题实例，再用目标规划和高效单目标算法解决其他实例。

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题基准实例中，方法能在短时间内产生良好结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，适用于适应度景观相似的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯推断的广泛应用受到先验分布和似然函数设定复杂性的限制，需要统计专业知识。本文旨在探索LLM能否自动化这一过程。

Method: 提出LLM-BI框架，通过两个实验验证：实验一测试LLM从自然语言中提取先验分布的能力；实验二测试LLM从高层问题描述中指定完整模型结构（包括先验和似然）的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM能够成功自动化贝叶斯建模中的关键步骤，验证了自动化推断管道的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM在贝叶斯建模中具有自动化潜力，为概率编程的自动化推断提供了可能。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FATA是一种新的交互范式，通过引导LLMs主动生成补充问题，提升回答质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户信息不完整时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 提出FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，整合用户信息优化回答。

Result: FATA在多项指标上优于基线方法，稳定性更高。

Conclusion: FATA通过用户参与和单轮策略显著提升了LLMs的交互效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法区分模型是推理还是直接检索答案，且评估指标不一致，需改进。

Method: 提出了一种构建基准和评估协议的通用方法，用于系统评估KG-RAG方法在知识缺失下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，现有KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需改进KG-RAG方法以提升其在知识缺失时的推理能力，并采用更严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

TL;DR: UrzaGPT是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的AI，用于实时推荐《魔法风云会》中的选牌决策，通过低秩适应微调提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于集换式卡牌游戏（CCG）的部分可观察性、长期决策和不断变化的卡牌库，现有AI表现远不如人类玩家，UrzaGPT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 从开放权重的LLM出发，使用低秩适应（LoRA）对标注的选牌日志数据集进行微调，利用LLM的语言建模能力快速适应游戏的不同扩展。

Result: 未经调优的小型LLM（如Llama-3-8B）完全无法选牌，而GPT-4o的零样本性能为43%。UrzaGPT微调后的小型模型在10,000步内达到66.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 尽管未达到领域专用模型的水平，但研究表明仅用LLM实现选牌AI是可行的，未来LLM可能实现高性能、通用且易于更新的选牌AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划中因搜索深度d较大，节点选择的时间复杂度较高（O(log N)），成为性能瓶颈。本文旨在优化这一过程。

Method: 提出双层MCTS，从每个选中的叶节点运行最佳优先搜索，并引入树折叠技术以减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的性能瓶颈，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译时生成所有组合并通过部分评估丢弃无效项，效率低下，尤其是当归纳变量范围大且具有选择性前提条件时。

Method: 使用求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，避免完全枚举。

Result: 生成的模型与传统方法相同，但编译速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了高级用户模型转换为求解器就绪形式的效率，特别是在大范围归纳变量和选择性前提条件下。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill通过分离LLM推理的预填充和解码阶段，优化了准确性与效率的权衡，显著提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在推理时面临高成本问题，尤其是解码阶段对长序列的延迟影响显著。当前模型对预填充和解码阶段采用统一处理，未充分利用其计算特性。

Method: 提出OverFill，将预填充和解码阶段解耦：预填充使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换到密集剪枝模型并顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B到1B的OverFill配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B到3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%，且训练数据需求显著减少。

Conclusion: OverFill在保持性能的同时显著降低了训练和推理成本，为LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic

to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second

### [135] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出，仅依赖序数比较的LLM对齐方法无法系统恢复最优模型，提出使用基数反馈（如支付意愿）来改进模型选择，并通过实验验证其优于序数方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖序数偏好数据，但无法解决模型间的权衡问题，导致无法系统选择最优模型。

Method: 提出使用基数反馈（如支付意愿）收集数据，并公开25,000条基数判断数据集，将其融入偏好微调。

Result: 实验表明，基数反馈方法能优先高影响力改进，在下游基准（如Arena-Hard）上优于序数方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是解决LLM对齐中模型选择问题的有效方法，优于传统序数偏好数据。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管POMO在组合优化问题中表现优异，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在初始节点利用方面。

Method: 提出POMO+方法，通过更智能地利用初始节点优化解决方案。

Result: POMO+在CVRPLIB数据集上收敛更快且结果更优，尤其适用于100个客户以内的问题实例。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合优化领域提供了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体对齐在跨领域数据集成中至关重要，但现有系统难以生成高质量对应关系，人工验证成本高昂。

Method: 利用LLM仅验证本体对齐系统中不确定的对应关系，并通过OAEI任务评估多种LLM的性能。

Result: LLM在验证不确定对应关系时表现良好，并与模拟Oracle进行了对比。

Conclusion: LLM可作为领域专家的替代方案，降低人工验证成本。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

Motivation: 现有LLM基准大多缺乏对空间推理和规划能力的测试，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白，推动语言模型在上下文推理和代理行为方面的研究。

Method: 基于General Video Game AI框架，通过游戏描述语言快速生成多样化游戏场景，使用ASCII字符表示游戏画面，定义可解释的评估指标（如有效步数比、步效率等）。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和基础规划上存在明显不足，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，但当前模型仍远未解决其挑战。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量合成医疗数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估确保数据质量与隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，合成数据成为替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和全面评估框架。

Method: SynLLM采用四种提示类型（如规则约束）指导LLM生成数据，无需微调，并通过统计保真度、临床一致性和隐私保护等多维度评估。

Result: 在三种医疗数据集上测试显示，规则提示在隐私与质量间取得最佳平衡，LLM可生成临床合理且隐私安全的合成数据。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明通过精心设计的提示和全面评估，LLM能生成高质量合成医疗数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Result: UGM2N在多种PDE和网格几何中表现出色，具有高效、可扩展且无网格纠缠的优势。

Conclusion: UGM2N为网格适配提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案，适用于多样化的物理系统建模。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Result: AgriGPT在农业领域表现显著优于通用LLM。

Conclusion: AgriGPT为农业提供了一个模块化、可扩展的LLM生态系统，并为其他领域LLM开发提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“diminution”的方法，通过选择Herbrand宇宙的子集来减少ASP中的基础程序规模，从而显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而面临性能瓶颈，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 定义了diminution的概念，并开发了一种编码方法，利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，该方法平均减少70%的基础时间和85%的基础文件大小。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver

the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂多模态任务中表现不佳，且输出冗长，主要依赖链式推理（CoT），而许多任务需要树或图等拓扑结构。

Method: 采用TopoAug数据增强生成多样化拓扑结构，结合监督微调和强化学习训练Qwen2VL模型，并引入Frugal Learning以减少输出长度。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，STELAR-Vision比基础模型准确率提升9.7%，优于Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct 7.3%；在五个OOD基准测试中，表现优于Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct和LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效学习策略，显著提升了多模态任务的性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

Motivation: 现有社交代理多为场景定制，缺乏统一框架，限制了其泛化能力和行为一致性。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，提出包含动机、行动规划和学习模块的系统设计框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架生成的代理行为更接近真实人类行为，偏差降低75%，模块缺失会导致误差增加1.5至3.2倍。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的框架显著提升了社交代理的行为真实性和适应性，为通用社交代理设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来智能AR系统的开发提供了方向，旨在通过结合用户交互历史实现更自适应的任务辅助。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的知识编辑分类法，补充现有机制导向的研究，分析不同知识类型对编辑效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有研究多关注编辑机制，忽略了知识功能的作用。

Method: 引入基于功能的分类法，结合知识类型（事实、时间、概念、常识、社会）和编辑机制，全面分析编辑效果。

Result: 通过双轴分类法，梳理了当前研究现状，总结了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了评估任务和数据集。

Conclusion: 知识编辑领域仍面临挑战，未来需进一步探索更高效的编辑方法和更全面的评估体系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了GRainsaCK，一个用于标准化评估知识图谱链接预测解释方法的软件资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，现有链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏统一的评估标准和资源。

Method: 开发了GRainsaCK，一个模块化、可扩展的软件资源，支持从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Result: GRainsaCK实现了评估流程的标准化，并提供了详细的文档和教程。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释评估的空白，促进了方法的可复用性和比较。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent框架通过动态规划多模态工具和优化执行序列，解决了现有mRAG方法在检索策略和视觉信息利用上的不足，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在实时场景（如新闻分析）中的时间限制问题，并改进现有mRAG方法的刚性检索策略和视觉信息利用不足。

Method: 提出E-Agent框架，包含动态规划多模态工具的mRAG规划器和优化执行序列的任务执行器，采用一次性mRAG规划策略减少冗余工具调用。

Result: 在RemPlan基准测试中，E-Agent比现有mRAG方法准确率提升13%，冗余搜索减少37%。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过动态规划和优化执行序列，显著提升了mRAG系统的性能和效率，适用于需要动态决策的现实场景。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

Motivation: 探索AI（尤其是MLLMs）在情绪识别方面的能力，并与人类专家对比，以推动情感智能AI的发展。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试评估MLLMs的情绪识别能力，并与人类参与者对比。

Result: MLLMs在个体层面优于人类，但人类集体智慧更强；人机协作表现最佳。

Conclusion: MLLMs在情绪识别中表现突出，但人类集体智慧和人机协作更具潜力，为情感智能AI的发展指明方向。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统通常采用单代理范式，导致认知负载干扰，影响推理和代码生成的效率。

Method: 提出双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成和执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 双代理设计减少了认知干扰，提升了推理与代码生成的协调性。

Conclusion: 双代理框架能有效解决单代理系统的认知负载问题，提升数学推理的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension

involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the

costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal

vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及表达不确定性的认知标记（如“可能”）是否影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验，发现PT建模LLMs决策并不完全可靠，尤其是当不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前景理论（PT）用于人类不确定性决策，但尚未明确是否适用于LLMs，且认知标记对其决策的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出通用评估框架，结合认知标记的概率值分析其对LLMs决策的影响。

Result: PT建模LLMs决策的可靠性不一致，特别是在不确定性以多样化语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLMs决策中的应用有限，认知标记的多样性影响其可靠性。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning

Method: 1. 训练线性探针检测模型内部激活中的偏见表征；2. 计算转向向量，通过调整激活模式实时减少偏见生成。

Result: 实验表明，探针能近乎完美地识别偏见，转向向量有效将偏见生成导向中性内容。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更安全、可解释的LLMs提供了直接且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

Result: 在包含3000万条记录的共享乘车数据集上，FiXGBoost表现出良好的预测性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为预请求等待时间预测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案，有助于提升用户体验和平台效率。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Result: 在10个CVCM故障案例中验证，准确率99.31%，检测时间在异常开始的1%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他轨道电路和铁路系统，提升运营可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

Result: SMA能够有效区分生成内容的来源，并首次支持图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角，将焦点从‘数据是否被记忆’转移到‘内容来源’。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA

Result: 在英文和中文基准测试中表现优异，BrowseComp-en得分30.0，BrowseComp-zh得分46.5。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂信息搜索任务中展现出强大能力，克服了现有代理的局限性。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

### [165] [Designing for Disclosure in Data Visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08383)
*Krisha Mehta,Gordon Kindlmann,Alex Kale*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可视化中的信息披露策略分类法，分析了425个可视化技术案例，揭示了设计中信息揭示、隐藏或扭曲的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化工具和框架缺乏对信息披露的明确指导，研究旨在系统化描述可视化如何限制对底层数据的访问。

Method: 通过对425个可视化技术案例的内容分析，构建了一个基于数据表示变化的分类法。

Result: 分类法为设计权衡提供了系统化的思考方式，展示了在设计场景中的应用价值。

Conclusion: 信息披露框架为可视化研究提供了新视角，涉及工具开发、素养提升、不确定性传达、个性化和伦理设计。

Abstract: Visualizing data often entails data transformations that can reveal and hide
information, operations we dub disclosure tactics. Whether designers hide
information intentionally or as an implicit consequence of other design
choices, tools and frameworks for visualization offer little explicit guidance
on disclosure. To systematically characterize how visualizations can limit
access to an underlying dataset, we contribute a content analysis of 425
examples of visualization techniques sampled from academic papers in the
visualization literature, resulting in a taxonomy of disclosure tactics. Our
taxonomy organizes disclosure tactics based on how they change the data
representation underlying a chart, providing a systematic way to reason about
design trade-offs in terms of what information is revealed, distorted, or
hidden. We demonstrate the benefits of using our taxonomy by showing how it can
guide reasoning in design scenarios where disclosure is a first-order
consideration. Adopting disclosure as a framework for visualization research
offers new perspective on authoring tools, literacy, uncertainty communication,
personalization, and ethical design.

TL;DR: Capybara是一个基于AR和AI的可视化编程环境，帮助儿童从消费者转变为创作者，通过生成式AI和视觉模型实现3D角色创作与交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI和AR技术多将儿童定位为消费者而非创作者，限制了他们的学习潜力。

Method: Capybara结合文本生成3D模型、自动绑定、身体追踪和视觉AI模型，支持儿童创建虚拟角色并编程交互行为。

Result: 用户研究表明，Capybara能有效帮助儿童创作个性化的AR体验，连接虚拟与现实世界。

Conclusion: Capybara展示了AI和AR技术如何赋能儿童成为创作者，提升学习体验。

Abstract: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences,
AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position
children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based
and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create,
customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara
enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D
generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and
body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to
recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors
between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted
user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings
suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring
personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and
physical worlds.

*Marta Robledo-Moreno,Ruben Vera-Rodriguez,Ruben Tolosana,Javier Ortega-Garcia,Andres Huergo,Julian Fierrez*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AirSignatureDB是一个公开数据集，包含108名参与者在真实条件下使用83种智能手机模型采集的空中签名数据，用于评估系统鲁棒性。研究还探索了从惯性传感器数据重建三维轨迹的方法，并提出了隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提供空中签名验证的公开数据集，并探索其隐私边界，因为惯性传感器数据可能泄露用户特定信息。

Method: 收集了真实世界条件下的空中签名数据，包括真实样本和伪造样本，并比较了传统和深度学习方法。此外，提出了一种从惯性传感器数据重建三维轨迹的方法。

Result: 研究发现重建空中签名的三维轨迹是可行的，挑战了空中手势无迹可循的假设，同时揭示了隐私风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调了重新评估惯性传感器数据隐私假设的必要性，因其可能泄露未被考虑的用户信息。

Abstract: Behavioral biometrics based on smartphone motion sensors are growing in
popularity for authentication purposes. In this study, AirSignatureDB is
presented: a new publicly accessible dataset of in-air signatures collected
from 108 participants under real-world conditions, using 83 different
smartphone models across four sessions. This dataset includes genuine samples
and skilled forgeries, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of system robustness
against realistic attack scenarios. Traditional and deep learning-based methods
for in-air signature verification are benchmarked, while analyzing the
influence of sensor modality and enrollment strategies. Beyond verification, a
first approach to reconstructing the three-dimensional trajectory of in-air
signatures from inertial sensor data alone is introduced. Using on-line
handwritten signatures as a reference, we demonstrate that the recovery of
accurate trajectories is feasible, challenging the long-held assumption that
in-air gestures are inherently traceless. Although this approach enables
forensic traceability, it also raises critical questions about the privacy
boundaries of behavioral biometrics. Our findings underscore the need for a
reevaluation of the privacy assumptions surrounding inertial sensor data, as
they can reveal user-specific information that had not previously been
considered in the design of in-air signature systems.

*Chao-Jung Lai,Mauricio Sousa,Tianyu Zhang,Ludwig Sidenmark,Tovi Grossman*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Adaptique是一种自适应模型，根据用户和环境信息推断并切换最优选择技术，解决了虚拟现实中目标选择的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实中的目标选择因目标距离远、尺寸小、遮挡和环境密集等问题而具有挑战性，现有技术复杂且繁琐。

Method: Adaptique通过结合目标大小、距离、遮挡和用户姿势等上下文信息，以及速度、准确性、舒适性和熟悉度四个目标，选择最优技术。

Result: 用户研究表明，Adaptique比单一技术更受欢迎且性能更好，并在应用中展示了其多功能性。

Conclusion: Adaptique通过自适应选择技术，显著提升了虚拟现实中的目标选择效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Selection is a fundamental task that is challenging in virtual reality due to
issues such as distant and small targets, occlusion, and target-dense
environments. Previous research has tackled these challenges through various
selection techniques, but complicates selection and can be seen as tedious
outside of their designed use case. We present Adaptique, an adaptive model
that infers and switches to the most optimal selection technique based on user
and environmental information. Adaptique considers contextual information such
as target size, distance, occlusion, and user posture combined with four
objectives: speed, accuracy, comfort, and familiarity which are based on
fundamental predictive models of human movement for technique selection. This
enables Adaptique to select simple techniques when they are sufficiently
efficient and more advanced techniques when necessary. We show that Adaptique
is more preferred and performant than single techniques in a user study, and
demonstrate Adaptique's versatility in an application.

TL;DR: StreetViewAI是首个为盲人设计的可访问街景工具，结合多模态AI和语音导航，支持盲人远程探索和路线规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有街景工具（如Google Street View）对盲人用户不可访问，StreetViewAI旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合上下文感知的多模态AI、可访问导航控制和对话语音，团队与视觉障碍用户合作迭代设计。

Result: 评估显示StreetViewAI能有效支持盲人用户进行地点探索和路线规划。

Conclusion: StreetViewAI的成功为未来可访问性工具开发提供了关键指导。

Abstract: Interactive streetscape mapping tools such as Google Street View (GSV) and
Meta Mapillary enable users to virtually navigate and experience real-world
environments via immersive 360{\deg} imagery but remain fundamentally
inaccessible to blind users. We introduce StreetViewAI, the first-ever
accessible street view tool, which combines context-aware, multimodal AI,
accessible navigation controls, and conversational speech. With StreetViewAI,
blind users can virtually examine destinations, engage in open-world
exploration, or virtually tour any of the over 220 billion images and 100+
countries where GSV is deployed. We iteratively designed StreetViewAI with a
mixed-visual ability team and performed an evaluation with eleven blind users.
Our findings demonstrate the value of an accessible street view in supporting
POI investigations and remote route planning. We close by enumerating key
guidelines for future work.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DIXTRAL是一个为盲人和低视力用户设计的网络原生系统，通过多模态交互改善3D数据可视化的非视觉访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户在3D数据可视化中因依赖视觉交互而被排除在外，现有方法在非视觉访问支持上不足。

Method: 与BLV研究人员共同设计DIXTRAL系统，通过同步听觉、视觉和文本反馈，结合键盘和游戏手柄导航进行测试。

Result: 多模态交互增强了结构发现和方向感，提升了3D连续标量场的访问性。

Conclusion: DIXTRAL为盲人和低视力用户提供了更好的3D数据访问方式，并为创建包容性3D可视化提供了最佳实践。

Abstract: Blind and low-vision (BLV) users remain largely excluded from
three-dimensional (3D) surface and point data visualizations due to the
reliance on visual interaction. Existing approaches inadequately support
non-visual access, especially in browser-based environments. This study
introduces DIXTRAL, a hosted web-native system, co-designed with BLV
researchers to address these gaps through multimodal interaction. Conducted
with two blind and one sighted researcher, this study took place over sustained
design sessions. Data were gathered through iterative testing of the prototype,
collecting feedback on spatial navigation, sonification, and usability.
Co-design observations demonstrate that synchronized auditory, visual, and
textual feedback, combined with keyboard and gamepad navigation, enhances both
structure discovery and orientation. DIXTRAL aims to improve access to 3D
continuous scalar fields for BLV users and inform best practices for creating
inclusive 3D visualizations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CoSight是一个Chrome扩展，通过轻量化的提示帮助普通观众在观看和评论YouTube视频时提供视觉描述，以补充专业音频描述（AD）的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频内容快速增长，但盲人和低视力（BLV）观众的可访问性需求未被满足，专业AD成本高且难以规模化。

Method: CoSight基于Fogg行为模型，提供视觉提示、描述建议、模糊评论提醒和相关参考内容，以鼓励观众描述视频内容。

Result: 48名视力正常用户的探索性研究中，89%的评论包含视觉描述；BLV观众和AD专家认为这些评论虽不及专业AD，但能补充视觉背景和情感细节。

Conclusion: CoSight展示了通过普通观众参与提升视频可访问性的潜力，为BLV观众提供了额外的视觉信息支持。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content has outpaced efforts to make visual
information accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) audiences. While
professional Audio Description (AD) remains the gold standard, it is costly and
difficult to scale across the vast volume of online media. In this work, we
explore a complementary approach to broaden participation in video
accessibility: engaging everyday video viewers at their watching and commenting
time. We introduce CoSight, a Chrome extension that augments YouTube with
lightweight, in-situ nudges to support descriptive commenting. Drawing from
Fogg's Behavior Model, CoSight provides visual indicators of accessibility
gaps, pop-up hints for what to describe, reminders to clarify vague comments,
and related captions and comments as references. In an exploratory study with
48 sighted users, CoSight helped integrate accessibility contribution into
natural viewing and commenting practices, resulting in 89% of comments
including grounded visual descriptions. Follow-up interviews with four BLV
viewers and four professional AD writers suggest that while such comments do
not match the rigor of professional AD, they can offer complementary value by
conveying visual context and emotional nuance for understanding the videos.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI在数字服务中的大规模部署及其对环境的影响，分析了科技公司如何通过界面设计强制推广AI使用，并提出了监管建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示科技公司如何通过设计策略强制用户使用AI，以及这种强制推广对环境造成的潜在危害。

Method: 通过分析用户界面设计和宣传策略，识别出两种主要的强制推广AI的设计策略。

Result: 发现科技公司通过牺牲非AI功能和宣传AI叙事来强制推广AI使用，可能导致负面环境影响。

Conclusion: 建议对强制推广AI功能进行监管，以减少其对环境的负面影响。

Abstract: Generative AI is being massively deployed in digital services, at a scale
that will result in significant environmental harm. We document how tech
companies are transforming established user interfaces to impose AI use and
show how and to what extent these strategies fit within established deceptive
pattern categories. We identify two main design strategies that are implemented
to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI
features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting
narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss
opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would
inevitably lead to negative environmental effects.

TL;DR: Caption是一个基于LLM的工具，用于为移动设备上的视觉交互元素生成内容标签，通过结合交互前后的屏幕信息，提供更准确和描述性的标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开发者忽视导致的图像元素标签缺失或不准确的问题，提升屏幕阅读器的可用性。

Method: Caption通过导航到交互后的目标屏幕，结合源屏幕和目标屏幕的信息生成标签。

Result: 初步结果显示，Caption生成的标签比人工标注和LLM基线更准确。

Conclusion: Caption有望帮助开发者提供可操作的无障碍建议，并支持屏幕阅读器用户按需修复。

Abstract: We present Caption, an LLM-powered content label generation tool for visual
interactive elements on mobile devices. Content labels are essential for screen
readers to provide announcements for image-based elements, but are often
missing or uninformative due to developer neglect. Automated captioning systems
attempt to address this, but are limited to on-screen context, often resulting
in inaccurate or unspecific labels. To generate more accurate and descriptive
labels, Caption collects next-screen context on interactive elements by
navigating to the destination screen that appears after an interaction and
incorporating information from both the origin and destination screens.
Preliminary results show Caption generates more accurate labels than both human
annotators and an LLM baseline. We expect Caption to empower developers by
providing actionable accessibility suggestions and directly support on-demand
repairs by screen reader users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教授数据可视化时，常需解释数据管理和数据呈现的复杂问题，因此需要一种有效的教学方法。

Method: 通过一系列数据驱动的场景，展示具体情境，帮助教师突出数据沟通中的关键问题。

Result: 提供了一套示例场景，供教育工作者用于课程，并抽象出原则供他人开发自己的教学场景。

Conclusion: 该方法与真实和基于场景的学习原则一致，利用现实情境促进学生批判性思考数据。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of scenario-based visualisation examples as a
pedagogical strategy for teaching students the complexities of data insight,
representation, and interpretation. Teaching data visualisation often involves
explaining intricate issues related to data management and the challenges of
presenting data meaningfully. In this work, we present a series of data-driven
scenarios. These concise stories depict specific situations, and are created to
help the educators highlight key concerns in data communication, such as chart
selection, temporal versus categorical comparison, visual bias, and narrative
framing. By grounding these examples in real-world contexts, students are
encouraged to critically assess not only what the data shows, but how and why
it is shown that way. The paper presents a collection of example scenarios,
that educators can use for their own lessons; the work fits with a larger
project on looking at critical thinking in the classroom, and developing
appropriate tools. We also start to abstract principles, from our approach, so
that others can develop their own scenarios for their teaching. Our approach
aligns with principles of authentic and scenario-based learning, using
real-world contexts to foster critical engagement with data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化领域结构分散，博士生难以全面理解学科及建立跨机构合作关系。

Method: 设计了一门博士生课程，包括与其他博士教育活动互动及实地考察多个研究小组。

Result: 课程首次在2023年秋季学期实施，为类似课程的设计和改进提供了经验。

Conclusion: 该课程为博士生提供了学科整体视角，对其他教育者设计类似课程有借鉴意义。

Abstract: Visualization is a heterogeneous field, and this aspect is often reflected by
the organizational structures at higher education institutions that academic
researchers in visualization and related fields including computer graphics,
human-computer interaction, and media design are typically affiliated with. It
may thus be a challenge for new PhD students to grasp the fragmented structure
of their new workplace, form collegial relations across the institution, and to
build a coherent picture of the discipline as a whole. We report an attempt to
address this challenge, in the form of an introductory course on the subject of
Visualization Technology and Methodology for PhD students at the Division for
Media and Information Technology, Link\"oping University, Sweden. We discuss
the course design, including interactions with other doctoral education
activities and field trips to multiple research groups and units within the
division (ranging from scientific visualization and computer graphics to media
design and visual communication). Lessons learned from the course preparation
work as well as the first instance of the course offered during autumn term
2023 can be helpful to researchers and educators aiming to establish or improve
similar doctoral courses.

Result: GenAI在多个制图环节中具有潜力，但在需要深度制图知识或高精度的任务中存在局限。

Conclusion: GenAI为制图学提供了新方向，但需关注伦理和社会影响，未来研究需进一步探索其应用边界。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models,
diffusion-based image generation models, and GenAI agents, has provided new
opportunities for advancements in mapping and cartography. Due to their
characteristics including world knowledge and generalizability, artistic style
and creativity, and multimodal integration, we envision that GenAI may benefit
a variety of cartographic design decisions, from mapmaking (e.g.,
conceptualization, data preparation, map design, and map evaluation) to map use
(such as map reading, interpretation, and analysis). This paper discusses
several important topics regarding why and how GenAI benefits cartography with
case studies including symbolization, map evaluation, and map reading. Despite
its unprecedented potential, we identify key scenarios where GenAI may not be
suitable, such as tasks that require a deep understanding of cartographic
knowledge or prioritize precision and reliability. We also emphasize the need
to consider ethical and social implications, such as concerns related to
hallucination, reproducibility, bias, copyright, and explainability. This work
lays the foundation for further exploration and provides a roadmap for future
research at the intersection of GenAI and cartography.

Abstract: The promise of human-AI teaming lies in humans and AI working together to
achieve performance levels neither could accomplish alone. Effective
communication between AI and humans is crucial for teamwork, enabling users to
efficiently benefit from AI assistance. This paper investigates how AI
communication impacts human-AI team performance. We examine AI explanations
that convey an awareness of its strengths and limitations. To achieve this, we
train a decision tree on the model's mistakes, allowing it to recognize and
explain where and why it might err. Through a user study on an income
prediction task, we assess the impact of varying levels of information and
explanations about AI predictions. Our results show that AI performance
insights enhance task performance, and conveying AI awareness of its strengths
and weaknesses improves trust calibration. These findings highlight the
importance of considering how information delivery influences user trust and
reliance in AI-assisted decision-making.

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解招聘实践对全球知识传播的影响，并促进GIScience领域的学术公平。

Abstract: Academia is profoundly influenced by faculty hiring networks, which serve as
critical conduits for knowledge dissemination and the formation of
collaborative research initiatives. While extensive research in various
disciplines has revealed the institutional hierarchies inherent in these
networks, their impacts within GIScience remain underexplored. To fill this
gap, this study analyzes the placement patterns of 946 GIScience faculty
worldwide by mapping the connections between PhD-granting institutions and
current faculty affiliations. Our dataset, which is compiled from
volunteer-contributed information, is the most comprehensive collection
available in this field. While there may be some limitations in its
representativeness, its scope and depth provide a unique and valuable
perspective on the global placement patterns of GIScience faculty. Our analysis
reveals several influential programs in placing GIScience faculty, with hiring
concentrated in the western countries. We examined the diversity index to
assess the representation of regions and institutions within the global
GIScience faculty network. We observe significant internal retention at both
the continental and country levels, and a high level of non-self-hired ratio at
the institutional level. Over time, research themes have also evolved, with
growing research clusters emphasis on spatial data analytics, cartography and
geovisualization, geocomputation, and environmental sciences, etc. These
results illuminate the influence of hiring practices on global knowledge
dissemination and contribute to promoting academic equity within GIScience and
Geography.
