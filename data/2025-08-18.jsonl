As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as\nmodel combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.\nAmong ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with\nvarious weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the\nexisting methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights\nconsider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various\ninformation that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this\npaper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information\nthrough cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,\nvarious types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be\nsimultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight\ndistribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were\napplied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble\nweighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance\ncompared to other weighting methods."}

However, the design of\njournalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance\nmultiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience's expected data literacy,\ntight publication deadlines, and the team's technical skills. Data journalists\noften come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and\ndata science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While\nprevious studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this\nresearch seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process\nemployed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific\nresearch questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do\neditorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we\ncollected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news\narticles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result,\nwe created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both\nproperties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features\nof maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured\ninterviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily.\nThrough these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made\nby editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected\nthe practitioners' feedback on our design space to externally validate it.

However, a persistent and\nsubstantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.\nBridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and\ntime-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between\nhigh-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages\n(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing\nmanners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose\nA2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable\nalgorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework\nthat enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common\nhallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,\nA2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,\nsimplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical\ndimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs\nstep-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as\nMATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

But we\ndo not just follow rules and solve problems given to us by others: we modify\nthose rules, create new problems, and set new goals and tasks for ourselves and\nothers. Arguably, even more than rule following and problem solving, human\nintelligence is about creatively breaking and stretching the rules, changing\nthe game, and inventing new problems worth thinking about. Creating a good rule\nor a good problem depends not just on the ideas one can think up but on how one\nevaluates such proposals. Here, we study invention through the lens of game\ndesign. We focus particularly on the early stages of novice, \"everyday\" game\ncreation, where the stakes are low. We draw on a dataset of over 450 human\ncreated games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of\ntwo-player grid-based strategy games. We consider two different cognitive\nmechanisms that may be at work during the early processes of intuitive game\ninvention: an associative proposal based on previous games one has seen and\ncompute-bounded model-based evaluation that an everyday game creator may use to\nrefine their initial draft proposals. In our preliminary work, we conduct a\nmodel-based analysis of how people invented new games based on prior experience\nand find that generated games are best described by a model which incorporates\nmodel-based estimates of game quality at a population level. Our work points to\nhow human invention is based not only on what people propose, but how they\nevaluate and offers a computational toolkit to scale empirical studies of\nmodel-based simulation in open-ended human innovation."}

We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program.

This research introduces a new framework\nnamed FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks\nand graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework\nconstructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,\nintegrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit\ncompatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically\nweights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture\nof key interactions and generating precise representations for both user\npreferences and outfit compatibility.

Many existing methods treat posts independently\nand fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time\nand modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for\nrobustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into\npseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then\nprocesses each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual\nfeatures are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via\nintra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal\nattention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form\ncontextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal\nevolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a\ntrend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode\nnarrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event\nlevel, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To\naddress class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates\nadaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example\nmining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments\non Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47\ndiverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by\nrobust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk\nPrevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age\nAppropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing\nchild-centric AI design and deployment."}

Therefore, this study focuses on\nimproving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,\n\\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal\nframework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model\nis trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk\nassessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the\nmodel to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child\nvisits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g.,\nprenatal/birth stages).

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods.

As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently\noutperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,\n1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with\nmethods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal\nperformance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive\nembedding dimensions in CKGE.

We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for\npredictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the\ninput which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective\nclass. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a\nnew regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and\ncompactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be\ndesirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language\nprocessing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and\nrationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed\nwithout training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained\nclassifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high\nquality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the\nconditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are\nmore broadly applicable to different input types."}

Our approach results in a single\nmodel that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on\ntheir relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used\nthree-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on\ntraining a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We\nsimplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles,\nleading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the\ncommon training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we\nextend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating\nrecent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales,\nthus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with\nhuman annotations without any explicit supervision."}
