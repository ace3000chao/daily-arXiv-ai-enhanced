Given\nthe rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as\nimportant as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In\nthis study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to\nefficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to\nlatent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer\ncaptures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex\nfeature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation\ncapability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,\nwhich is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs\ninclude raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta\ndegree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and\naircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA\nprediction is updated every second.

Addressing this gap, I introduce\nthe Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate\nintelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to\nunseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants\nmust develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a\nnovel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a\ntailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,\nevaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level\nstrategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,\nincluding public stages for development and private stages with structural and\nrule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization\ncapabilities.

Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality\ninformation (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an\nindependent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the\nredundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To\naddress this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise\ndynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking\nby dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is\nthen dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise\nlevel and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while\npreserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and\nflexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of\nmultimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a\nnew multimodal sentiment analysis approach.

Recent\nmodel-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply\noptimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading\nto a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This\npaper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)\ntheory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL\noptimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query\ncollision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the\ntransformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention\nwindow threshold (CWT).

While a growing\nbody of CSCW research centered on the future of work has begun to document\nthese shifts, relatively little is known about workers' experiences beyond\nthose of platform-mediated gig workers. In this paper, we turn to a traditional\nwork sector, Amazon fulfillment centers (FC), to deepen our field's empirical\nexamination of algorithmic management. Drawing on two years of ethnographic\nresearch, we show how FC workers react to managers' interventions, imposed\nproductivity rates, and quantified objectification when subjected to\nlabor-tracking systems in their physical work environments. Situating FC\nworkers' resistance to algorithmic systems and metrics within the current CSCW\nliterature allows us to explicate and link the nuanced practices of FC workers\nto the larger discourse of algorithmic control mechanisms. In addition, we show\nhow FC workers' resistance practices are emblematic of 'work games'--a\nlong-studied means by which workers agentically configure (\"trick\") their\nengagement within work systems.

However, recent\nstudies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as\nattention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve\ncomparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits\nattributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other\narchitectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a\ncentral question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series\nanalysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that\nsystematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models\nwith dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any\nsequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This\nsubstitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical\nfoundation for understanding its role.

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders.

For\neach pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the\nK-factor and refine win probabilities.

Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate\ntrajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement\nessential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse\nmulti-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical\ntrade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present\nEvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that\nestablishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and\nevaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as\na multi-round adversarial game.

These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable\nmulti-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures\nwithout collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial\ninterplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative\nmulti-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving\ntrajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks\ndemonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing\nDiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving\nScore on Bench2Drive.

Third, an orchestrated agent\npipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring\nhigh semantic alignment between user queries and the factual\n\"who-did-what-to-whom\" core captured by the graph.

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of\nnumerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros\nminimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as\nVariational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\napproaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population\nsynthesis.

However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs.

While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width\nto all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,\ninstance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.\nHowever, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly\ndequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,\nbreaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.\nThis paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework\nthat removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer\nrepresentation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within\nhigher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only\narithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost\nbit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable\nboth dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and\ntruly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight\ncontroller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer.

However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero\nelements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant\nstatistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph\nneural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static\ngraph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the\nlong-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these\nlimitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns\nadaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature\nrepresentations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.\nSpecifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages\na differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the\ngraph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem\nof a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood\nstructure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of\nscRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for\nrobust feature reconstruction.

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution.

To bridge the\nsemantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are\nembedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language\nmodel (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.\nBuilding upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently\nfine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are\nthen decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.", "AI": {"tldr": "TokenCast\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff09\u3002", "method": "TokenCast\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTokenCast\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TokenCast\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cLLM\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the availability of\ntrained clinicians has not scaled proportionally, leaving many people without\nadequate or timely support. To bridge this gap, recent studies have shown the\npromise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist mental health diagnosis,\nmonitoring, and intervention. However, the development of efficient, reliable,\nand ethical AI to assist clinicians is heavily dependent on high-quality\nclinical training datasets. Despite growing interest in data curation for\ntraining clinical AI assistants, existing datasets largely remain scattered,\nunder-documented, and often inaccessible, hindering the reproducibility,\ncomparability, and generalizability of AI models developed for clinical mental\nhealth care. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of\nclinical mental health datasets relevant to the training and development of\nAI-powered clinical assistants. We categorize these datasets by mental\ndisorders (e.g., depression, schizophrenia), data modalities (e.g., text,\nspeech, physiological signals), task types (e.g., diagnosis prediction, symptom\nseverity estimation, intervention generation), accessibility (public,\nrestricted or private), and sociocultural context (e.g., language and cultural\nbackground).

Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --\nexponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which\nlimits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance.

Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment\nstrategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying\nstrengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing\nvaluable insights for future research directions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982RLHF\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLMs\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel,\nexplainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:\nrecurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific\nprogramming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward\nthis, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative\npatterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code\nrepresentation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern\nimplementations from student code.

We aim to create a language model based on\nBadini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,\nhave a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready\ntranscriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78\nstories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted\nin approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized\nthe input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including\n19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and\nWhisper-small to develop the language models.

These domain-specific SAEs capture\nrelevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.\nWe conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain\nSAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and\nsuggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for\ngeneral-purpose SAEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e7f\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSAE\u5728\u5e7f\u57df\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u53ea\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9891\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6216\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3JumpReLU SAE\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Gemma-2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b2c20\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c19.5\u4e07\u4e34\u5e8a\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u9650\u5b9aSAE\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5dee\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u9650\u5b9a\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7f\u57dfSAE\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u901a\u7528SAE\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Traditional methods --\nstatistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution\nshifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high\nfalse positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal\nGraph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack\ndetection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised\nframework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal\ninvariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under \"Normal\"\nand \"Attack\" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs\nstructural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by\nevaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging\ncausal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in\nnon-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional\nmachine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile\nsensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher\nprecision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving\nresilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift.

While the spatio-spectral structure present in the\nproposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for\nenabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent\nproblems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that\ncombines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired\nstochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the\nphysics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed\napproach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and\ncomplex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent\nand time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed\nneural operator algorithms in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u03c0G-Sp\u00b2GNO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDEs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdbSp\u00b2GNO\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03c0G-Sp\u00b2GNO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent advances in graph generative modeling\noffer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and\nreducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models\nface key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code\n(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node\nattributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;\n(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight\nprediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive\ndesigns (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,\nlimiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric\ngenerative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG\ndecomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing\ninformative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite\nmessage-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while\na dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to\nreconstruct the adjacency matrix.

Our results\ndemonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate\n$ \\nu $, the condition $ N \\ge \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{algo}}}{\\nu^2} $ represents\na lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.\nThis threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving\ntheir existence becomes infeasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u4e0b\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u786e\u8ba4\u5f02\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e09\u767e\u4e07\u6b21\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e38\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0b\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\uff1aN \u2265 \u03b1_algo/\u03bd\u00b2\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u8ba4\u5f02\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u786e\u8ba4\u5f02\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a\nmulti-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as\nclicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to\nprovide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative\nmodel toward creating more effective combinations.

While machine learning models can\npredict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the\ndynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed\nand validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal\ncohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We\ndemonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has\nlimited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by\nengineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)\nof key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance.

However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a\nsparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make\npredictions, significantly reducing the computation time.
