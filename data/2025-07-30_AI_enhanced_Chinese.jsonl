Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the\nprotocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of\nAI decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSymbiotic Epistemology\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06AI\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SynLang\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5171\u751f\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SynLang\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTRACE\u548cTRACE_FE\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u5fc3\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ee7\u627f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSynLang\u6210\u529f\u652f\u6301AI\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "Symbiotic Epistemology\u548cSynLang\u534f\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f26\u7406\u8d23\u4efb\u3002"}}

However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality.

We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume.

Our findings show that\nGPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed\nquestion than to a neutral one. This suggests a \"rebound\" bias where the model\novercorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive\ntopics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:\ntone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We\nintroduce concepts like the \"tone floor\" - a lower bound in response negativity\n- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior.

The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites.

This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites.

Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in\nregions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the\nMediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management\nstrategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this\ncontext, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence\nof wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations.

MACD\nintegrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus\npenalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate\neffectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables\ncontrollable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or\ncontent biases.

Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human\ncommunication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,\nthis benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as\ndatasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for\nmachine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of\nanti-autistic biases in current research.

For\nthe cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the\nLLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask\nout the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the\npotential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive\nexperiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented\nspecialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up\nto the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially\nachieving ACC of 65.47\\% compared to the 56.12\\% achieved by GPT-4 on the\nObstetrics and Gynecology discipline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96c6\u7fa4\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u534f\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e14\u90e8\u5206LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97LLM\u5185\u90e8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914d\u503c\uff09\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u9010\u6b65\u5254\u9664\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\u7684LLM\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u96c6\u7fa4\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728NEJMQA\u548cMMLU-Pro-health\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728NEJMQA\u7684\u5987\u4ea7\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe65.47%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4\u768456.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly\nand time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible\nADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered\nautomated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems\nare decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination\narchitecture is designed.

In practical\nterms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and\nlinguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that\nhave been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way\nto objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a\ngiven text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the\nuse of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to\nknow which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary\ngenres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to\ndevise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute\nArabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.\nA comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their\ndefinitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was\nconstructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on\nthe morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an\nanalogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's\nrhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.\nAdditionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices\nused across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created.

Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two\ncategories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies\ntoo well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which\ncan suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to\ncouple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate\nobjectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit\ntheir expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically\nsolvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly\naligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated\non two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI\nsubtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,\nhyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,\nnon-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a\nmore clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of\nrobustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and\nscanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness\nof our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world\nmedical imaging applications.

Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for\ninvestigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are\nactually compositional.

Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order\nto test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given\nthat they have seen the atomic building blocks.

While prior work has\nlargely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often\nneglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,\nwe first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA\nPrinciples of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and\nthe CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nTrident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,\nfinancial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and\ndomain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals\nkey safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic\nexpectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle\nethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained\ndomain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work\nprovides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law\nand finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the\nsafety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields.

We propose a\ngeometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation\nDiagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical\nLLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce\nLatent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that\ncaptures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries\nin PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured\nprompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four\naxes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate\ncommon ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and\nclinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal\nsurface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical\nnotes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of\nLDFR beyond synthetic settings.

This study\nintroduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in\nmulti-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and\nXGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the\nbullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates\nhow local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual\ndemands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a\ncritical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for\ndynamic and efficient supply chain management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Liquid Neural Networks\uff08LNN\uff09\u548cXGBoost\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u7ea7\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba2\u5355\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u725b\u97ad\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7d2f\u79ef\u5229\u6da6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u9700\u6c42\u6ce2\u52a8\u3001\u5e93\u5b58\u5931\u8861\u548c\u725b\u97ad\u6548\u5e94\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5e02\u573a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LNN\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u548cXGBoost\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u725b\u97ad\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "LNN\u4e0eXGBoost\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work investigates\nwhether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to\nimprove both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that\nautomatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based\nclinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site\ndiagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649\nelectronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for\nextracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to\nmeasure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that\nclinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance\nin high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are\nlimited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is\noptimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports\nrather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,\ntraining models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify\nrationale-like features.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the\nInternet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating\nvarious forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and\nContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world\nwireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.\nWe will release our code to the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5355\u7ec4\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e94\u7528\uff08IMAs\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7ContextLoRA\u548cContextGear\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IMAs\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4e2aLLM\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5355LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316IMAs\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContextLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u5b66\u4e60IMAs\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u3002ContextGear\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7ec4\u5408LLM\u8303\u5f0f\u5728IMAs\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0cContextLoRA\u548cContextGear\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning.

Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess.

This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty\nbehaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors\nto unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such\nquestions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,\nconsisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by\nmulti-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked\nthe honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our\nfindings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when\nnecessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but\nis deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of\ndedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented\ninitial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve\nhonesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.\nOur data and code can be found at https://github.com/DSTTSD/MoHoBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MoHoBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u5185\u5bb9\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5176\u8bda\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b12k+\u6837\u672c\u7684MoHoBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8628\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cMLLMs\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4e14\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdbMLLMs\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u4fe1MLLMs\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To solve this important problem, we introduce\na Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by\ntranslating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding\nBenchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation\nand filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural\nflow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity\nrecognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41\ndatasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.\nIn our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary\nPositional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in\nembedding tasks.

While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in\ncapturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy\nwith very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context\nwindow).

By leveraging the LIMA-PE\nmicroarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in\nperformance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x\nincrease in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around\n~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel\noperations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEpochCore\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982RNN\u3001CNN\u548cTransformer\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cSSMs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u8017\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u6765\u4f18\u5316SSMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\uff08SAs\uff09\u7684EpochCore\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LIMA-PE\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u548cProDF\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4f20\u7edfDNN\u548cSSMs\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "EpochCore\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86250\u500d\u548c45\u500d\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9762\u79ef\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e862\u500d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728LRA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6bd4GPU\u5185\u6838\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea62000\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EpochCore\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SSMs\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),\n\"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset\nEnvironments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning\nmodels for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the\noriginal results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to\nstrengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the\nsetup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing\nresults to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the\nreplication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating\nreplication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across\ndifferent models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In\ncontrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed\nthat baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good\ngeneralization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed\nperformance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.\nAdditionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication\nreadiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced\nreadiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and\nprovide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and\nsupport the replication of our study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u4e00\u9879NLP4RE\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1NLP\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u8db3\u591f\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1NLP4RE\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u57fa\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecBERT\u3001ELMo\u548cGPT-4o\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u5404\u5f02\uff0cBERT\u548cELMo\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0cGPT-4o\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u57fa\u7ebf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u4f46\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NLP4RE\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u590d\u5236\u5305\u548cID\u5361\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u590d\u5236\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

The dataset suffers from egregious\ndata leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws\nthat invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491\ninactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more\nrepeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).\nCritically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test\ncases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.\nStructural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of\nquery ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1\nalone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation\nsets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws\ncollectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than\ngeneralize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,\nwe implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no\nphysics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including\ndeep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these\nartifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and\ncall into question previous results based on its use.

However, existing research has\nlargely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical\ndriving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)\nand propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based\nretrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering\n(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale\nmultimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18\nsub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety\nqueries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,\nenabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of\nthe models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge\ngraph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel\nmulti-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.\nBy incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this\nframework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical\nsituations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream\nVLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves\nperformance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in\nCorner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five\nmainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and\nmethodology for advancing research in traffic safety.

Among\nthese approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free\nnature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing\ntest-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with\nabundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying\nthese methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while\ndirectly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper\npersonalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we\npropose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to\nstore embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to\nstore class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each\nclient retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's\ncoordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both\nembedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution\nclients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients.

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a\npromising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,\nexploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural\ninformation. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information\nto prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only\non LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders.

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments.

In this paper, we propose\n$\\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed\nsampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential\nequations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the\noptimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost\nperformance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using\nSDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while\napplying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the\ntime-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and\nallowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.\nAdditionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in\noptimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a\nfaster variant, termed $\\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves\ntraining efficiency while achieving comparable performance.

These synthetic preferences are\nthen used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,\nsimilar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally\ncurated rewards.\n  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --\nrestoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step\nreasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and\nmultiple-choice question answering.\n  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms\nreinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and\ndata-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further\nresearch in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLSF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u5373\u53ef\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002RLSF\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "RLSF\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "RLSF\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "RLSF\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead\ndue to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.\nExisting acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early\nstopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via\nspeculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers\nfrom limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,\nand fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing\nconcise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a\ntoken-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT\ninference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large\nlanguage model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to\ngenerate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's\nconfidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback\nand selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency\nand answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible\nwith standard decoding pipelines.

Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.\nThe README files should contain project-related information as per the\nrecommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.\nHowever, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.\nThis prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This\nresearch posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file\nsignificantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail\npotentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact\nwithin the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great\nperformance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text\ngeneration, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach\nis developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections\nof GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,\nDistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a\ngold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1\nscore of 0.98.
