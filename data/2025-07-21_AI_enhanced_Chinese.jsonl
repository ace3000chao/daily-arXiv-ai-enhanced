It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives\nthrough a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who\nprovided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,\ncapturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm\ndemographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,\nrevealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that\ndiverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for\nbuilding aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,\nLLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.\nThis research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I\nsystems.

When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy.

We need to convert news articles into\nappropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques\nto transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the\nMinimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)\nalgorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for\nhandling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns\nthat traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our\nproposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and\nsubsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established\nnorms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528NLP\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u65b0\u95fb\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MDL-GBAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u6316\u6398\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u51a0\u76f8\u5173\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NLP\u5c06\u65b0\u95fb\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e94\u7528MDL-GBAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

These include the\nHuman-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human\napproval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows\nwith deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation\nupon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables\ndiscretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of\nthis work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key\ncontingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system\nreliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a\nsystematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human\noversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the\ntrade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of\nsafer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u516d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u6280\u672f\u670d\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5230\u88ab\u52a8AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u6025\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7531AI\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f7f\u7528\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b-\u4ee3\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u516d\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u670d\u52a1\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and\nGLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing\nneed for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that\ncapture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.\n  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic\nparameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound\nviews. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on\nKoopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical\nmetadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic\nsequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via\nattention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,\nresulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).\n  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac\npathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the\ncurve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five\nfolds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and\nspecificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based\nanalysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,\nwith optimal discrimination near this threshold.\n  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker\nfor cardiac function.

However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice\nQuestion (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there\nis no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is\nunclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and\nreflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate\nthe robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely\nused probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that\nall methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations.

While existing Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex\narchitectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer\nfrom scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.\nIn this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates\nshort-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE\nconsists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most\nrecent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware\nmodule that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence\nof globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an\nadaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on\ndata characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop\nmessage passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant\nimprovements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal\ngraphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance\nagainst state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,\ndelivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAGLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709T-GNN\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u65f6\u95f4\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EAGLE\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0cEAGLE\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709T-GNN\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d8550\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EAGLE\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86T-GNN\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions).

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance\ngains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all\ncontexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent.

However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results.

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels.

Existing methods can be\nbroadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep\nrepresentation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging\ndue to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the\nshort text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by\nrepresentation learning significantly increases the running time. To address\nthese issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet\nMultinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and\nhigh dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for\neach cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further\nrefinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further\noptimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively\nadjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that\nreveals more topic-related information.

This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers.

The approach\nis evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This\nbenchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training\nand test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a\ncommon real-world challenge.

These attack types are also used\nfor robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses\nthe stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.\nResults show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space\nattacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative\nand simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models.

However, the generation of training\ndatasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a\ncomputational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare\nevents or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation\nmodels that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular\ndatabases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data\nnecessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach\nrequires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can\nstill be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events\nand for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.\nIn on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely\nautomated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the\nmodel is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with\nclassical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying\nthis form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to\nassess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even\nthough most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In\nthis paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach\nbased on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow\nthat automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified\naccuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them\nat an increased rate relative to their occurrence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u529b\u573a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d8\u5f97\u6d3b\u8dc3\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6216\u5927\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bbe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u5927\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

This\nallows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer\nnetworks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal\nprocesses from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to\nconstructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested\nwithin the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we\nemploy RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the\noriginal Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in\ncausal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover\ngraphs of dynamic causal processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Causal Process\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Causal Process Model\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausal Process\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0Causal Process Model\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165RL\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RL\u4ee3\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728RL\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "Causal Process\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728RL\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u679c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a universal methodology\nfor Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of\nthe language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the\nFastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,\nthe first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA\nmodel sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related\ndatasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA\nwhile maintaining strong performance for MSA.

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have\nacquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging\nconsistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -\nsuch as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate\nthese biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or\noverlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nsite-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across\ndiverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a\nsimulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this\nframework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected\nautoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a\ntop-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight\nprediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior\npreservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as\nreflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although\nthe LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly\nmodeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world\nmulti-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable.

In natural\nlanguage processing, an approach has been used that combines local window\nattention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing\nlong-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to\nboth. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to\nlong-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we\npropose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates\ninterdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token\nbased on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the\nParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter\nmechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.\nOur architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer\nparameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly\noutperforms existing methods.

The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits.

Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them.

Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,\nrevealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,\npersisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We\nevaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of\nthe MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that\nuncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.\nFinally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic\nfunctions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing\nstability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u5927\u8111\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic\nhealth record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both\nphenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability\nof causal representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6846\u67b6CaRTeD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u591a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCaRTeD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff08MIMIC-III\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CaRTeD\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
