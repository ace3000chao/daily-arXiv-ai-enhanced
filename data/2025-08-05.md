### [1] [Rethinking Graph-Based Document Classification: Learning Data-Driven Structures Beyond Heuristic Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00864)
*Margarita Bugueño,Gerard de Melo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的图结构学习方法，用于文档分类，优于传统启发式方法，并通过统计过滤提升分类鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的文档表示多依赖启发式或领域知识，缺乏自动化和通用性。

Method: 构建同质加权图，节点为句子，边通过自注意力模型学习依赖关系，并使用统计过滤保留强相关句子。

Result: 在三个数据集上，学习到的图结构比启发式方法表现更好，准确率和F1分数更高。

Conclusion: 自动图生成方法优于传统启发式，为NLP应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

### [2] [FECT: Factuality Evaluation of Interpretive AI-Generated Claims in Contact Center Conversation Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00889)
*Hagyeong Shin,Binoy Robin Dalal,Iwona Bialynicka-Birula,Navjot Matharu,Ryan Muir,Xingwei Yang,Samuel W. K. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为3D（Decompose, Decouple, Detach）的范式，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在联系中心对话转录中生成的事实性。同时，引入了FECT基准数据集，并报告了LLM-judges在3D范式下的对齐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联系中心对话分析中，LLMs可能产生与输入无关的幻觉输出，这对业务决策有害。由于缺乏关于情感和问题根源的真实标签，评估事实性具有挑战性。

Method: 提出3D范式（分解、解耦、分离）作为人类标注指南和LLM-judges提示的基础，并创建FECT数据集用于评估。

Result: 通过3D范式，实现了对LLMs生成内容事实性的自动评估，并验证了LLM-judges在该范式下的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 研究为联系中心对话分析中的AI生成内容事实性评估提供了新方法，并通过3D范式和FECT数据集展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

### [3] [XAutoLM: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models via Meta-Learning and AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00924)
*Ernesto L. Estevanell-Valladares,Suilan Estevez-Velarde,Yoan Gutiérrez,Andrés Montoyo,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XAutoLM是一个基于元学习的AutoML框架，旨在高效优化语言模型的微调流程，减少计算资源和环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化框架未能同时解决模型选择和超参数优化问题，导致语言模型微调时资源浪费严重。

Method: XAutoLM通过提取任务和系统级元特征，复用历史经验，优化采样配置，避免无效尝试。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，XAutoLM显著提升性能，减少评估时间和错误率，并发现更多高效配置。

Conclusion: XAutoLM为资源高效的语言模型微调提供了新方法，推动了绿色AI的发展。

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

### [4] [MAO-ARAG: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01005)
*Yiqun Chen,Erhan Zhang,Lingyong Yan,Shuaiqiang Wang,Jizhou Huang,Dawei Yin,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAO-ARAG是一种自适应RAG框架，通过多智能体协作动态规划工作流，以平衡问答系统的性能和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定RAG管道在不同查询中难以平衡性能与成本的问题。

Method: 提出MAO-ARAG框架，利用多智能体编排（包括查询重构、文档选择和生成智能体），通过强化学习训练规划智能体。

Result: 在多个QA数据集上验证，动态规划工作流既保证了高质量答案，又控制了成本和延迟。

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过自适应多智能体协作，显著提升了问答系统的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

### [5] [UrBLiMP: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Linguistic Competence of Large Language Models in Urdu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01006)
*Farah Adeeba,Brian Dillon,Hassan Sajjad,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了UrBLiMP基准测试，用于评估多语言大模型在乌尔都语中的语法知识，发现模型表现差异显著，LLaMA-3-70B表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中的语法知识，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建UrBLiMP数据集，包含5,696对最小差异句子，覆盖十种核心语法现象，并进行人工评估。

Result: LLaMA-3-70B平均准确率最高（94.73%），但与其他顶级模型（如Gemma-3-27B-PT）无显著差异。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言的细粒度语法知识捕捉上既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Cross-Domain Web Information Extraction at Pinterest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01096)
*Michael Farag,Patrick Halina,Andrey Zaytsev,Alekhya Munagala,Imtihan Ahmed,Junhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pinterest提出了一种高效、低成本的结构化数据提取系统，通过结合网页的结构、视觉和文本信息，使用简单模型（如XGBoost）实现了比复杂模型（如GPT）更高的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上的非结构化信息难以转化为结构化数据，Pinterest需要从电商网站准确提取产品属性以提升用户体验和内容分发效率。

Method: 采用新颖的网页表示方法，将结构、视觉和文本模态结合为紧凑形式，适用于小型模型学习，并利用XGBoost等简单模型进行属性提取。

Result: 系统处理速度超过每秒1000个URL，准确性优于复杂模型（如GPT），且成本仅为GPT替代方案的千分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了简单模型在特定任务中优于复杂模型的潜力，同时具备高可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成结构化临床咨询模板的能力，发现模型在全面性上表现良好，但在简洁性和优先级排序上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在电子咨询中生成临床模板的潜力，以提升医生间的结构化信息交流。

Method: 使用145个专家模板，通过多代理流程（提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析）测试多个前沿模型。

Result: 模型在全面性上表现优异（最高92.2%），但模板过长且无法在长度限制下正确排序临床问题。性能因专科而异，叙事驱动领域表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs可提升临床信息交流，但需更鲁棒的评估方法以优化优先级排序能力。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

### [8] [CSIRO-LT at SemEval-2025 Task 11: Adapting LLMs for Emotion Recognition for Multiple Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01161)
*Jiyu Chen,Necva Bölücü,Sarvnaz Karimi,Diego Mollá,Cécile L. Paris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言情感识别任务，提出通过LoRA设置分别微调预训练多语言LLM的方法，效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于情感表达的文化和语言差异，跨语言情感检测具有挑战性。

Method: 采用LoRA设置分别微调预训练的多语言LLM，针对每种语言进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感识别任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 通过语言特定的微调策略，可以有效提升跨语言情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different
languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can
identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

### [9] [Adaptive Content Restriction for Large Language Models via Suffix Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01198)
*Yige Li,Peihai Jiang,Jun Sun,Peng Shu,Tianming Liu,Zhen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaCoRe的轻量级方法，通过优化后缀（SOP）来限制大型语言模型生成有害内容，无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的输出空间广泛，内容限制的需求因用户群体和时间变化而异，而传统的监督微调方法成本高昂，因此需要一种轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Suffix Optimization (SOP)方法，通过在提示后附加优化的短后缀，限制模型生成特定禁用词汇，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在CoReBench基准测试中，SOP在多个模型上平均限制率优于基线方法15%至6%，并在实际平台POE上验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: SOP是一种高效且实用的轻量级方法，适用于动态内容限制需求，无需模型微调。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

### [10] [Show or Tell? Modeling the evolution of request-making in Human-LLM conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01213)
*Shengqi Zhu,Jeffrey M. Rzeszotarski,David Mimno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务，将聊天查询分割为请求内容、角色、查询特定上下文和附加表达，并分析了用户行为模式随时间的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM用户行为的模式，尤其是请求表达与人类互动的差异，以及模型能力对用户行为的影响。

Method: 提出分割聊天查询的任务，并通过历时分析用户表达来研究行为模式的变化。

Result: 发现早期查询强调请求，用户行为随经验趋于收敛，模型能力的引入在社区层面可追踪影响。

Conclusion: 聊天查询的分割任务为理解LLM用户行为提供了新视角，模型更新显著影响用户行为模式。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

TL;DR: WebDS是一个首个端到端的基于网络的数据科学基准测试，包含870个任务，覆盖29个网站，旨在评估复杂、多步骤的数据科学工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络基准测试过于简单，传统数据科学基准测试则局限于静态数据集，无法反映实际数据科学任务的复杂性。

Method: 引入WebDS基准测试，包含多样化的任务和网站，要求代理使用工具处理异构数据格式。

Result: 当前最先进的LLM代理在WebDS任务中表现不佳，仅完成15%的任务，暴露出信息基础薄弱、重复行为和走捷径等问题。

Conclusion: WebDS为开发实用的LLM数据科学工具提供了更真实和全面的测试平台。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

TL;DR: WarriorMath框架通过针对性数据合成和渐进训练，提升LLM在数学问题上的表现，平均性能提升12.57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视LLM的特定失败模式，导致合成问题对性能提升有限。

Method: 结合多专家LLM协作生成、评估和改进问题，并通过渐进学习框架逐步微调模型。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中，WarriorMath平均性能提升12.57%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知的多专家框架能有效提升LLM的数学能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

TL;DR: 论文分析了2025年XAI挑战赛，该比赛旨在通过轻量级LLM或混合系统构建透明且可解释的教育问答系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在教育中透明性和可解释性的需求，特别是在真实教育场景中的应用。

Method: 采用hackathon形式，参与者需构建基于逻辑模板和Z3验证的问答系统，生成自然语言解释。

Result: 比赛成功推动了轻量级LLM与符号推理的结合，为未来XAI教育系统提供了实践见解。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛为XAI在教育领域的应用提供了新思路，并展示了hackathon在推动透明AI研究中的潜力。

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视角：通过部分相关知识唤醒LLMs的能力，解决了RAG系统中部分相关知识利用的挑战，并在KGQA任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中部分相关知识利用的难题，尤其是在知识库不完整的情况下。

Method: 通过构造部分相关知识（移除包含答案的路径），理论分析LLMs的唤醒效应，并在两个KGQA数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 提出的唤醒方法在实际应用中表现更优，优于依赖嵌入相似性的传统方法。

Conclusion: 部分相关知识可以唤醒LLMs的潜在能力，为RAG系统提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

Method: 采用低秩适应学习上下文编辑知识，设计多样化编辑增强技术和自适应推理机制。

Result: 在四个数据集上，KEDAS在36个案例中35个表现最佳，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KEDAS为知识编辑对齐提供了高效且稳健的范例。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量QA数据集的稀缺和高成本限制了领域特定LLMs的监督微调，D-SCoRE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: D-SCoRE通过文档中心处理、分段、CoT推理和结构化导出生成QA-COT数据集，并结合多维度控制机制增强多样性和相关性。

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Method: 通过构建知识图谱（KP graph），结合路径采样概率调整和扩散合成技术，生成多样化的问答数据。

Result: 合成的LinkQA数据集（50B tokens）在Llama-3 8B上预训练后，MMLU和CMMLU平均提升11.51%。

Conclusion: LinkSyn能有效生成高质量数据，显著提升模型性能，且适用于不同规模和初始FLOPs的模型。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Conclusion: BoostQA展示了强大的可扩展性，模型性能随规模、数据量和初始FLOPs的增加而持续提升。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

Conclusion: 该框架为自动生成经济高效的市场洞察提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automate end-to-end business analysis and market report generation.
At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的身份-概念关联，无法捕捉新的或意外的偏见形式。

Method: 提出Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF)，从开放生成内容中提取身份与概念的关联。

Result: BADF在多模型和多样场景下验证，能有效映射和分析偏见关联。

Conclusion: BADF为理解和分析LLM中的偏见提供了新工具，数据与代码已开源。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

Motivation: LLMs在多跳问答任务中表现不足，因其难以捕捉实体间深层关系。

Result: 在多个标准MQA基准测试中表现优异，媲美当前最优模型。

Conclusion: ORACLE生成更逻辑且可解释的推理链，验证了各组件有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法依赖未过滤的数据集，包含冗余和低质量样本，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。需要一种平衡样本难度和优化效用的策略。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Influence Quadrant（DIQ）策略，优先选择高难度高梯度影响的样本，以平衡复杂推理和优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，DIQ仅需1%的数据即可匹配全数据集性能，10%数据时优于基线。生成的医学推理更符合专家实践。

Conclusion: DIQ通过平衡样本难度和梯度影响，显著提升了医学推理任务的效率和质量，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在结构化领域（如源代码）中的应用存在挑战，因为编程语言具有严格的语法和语义规则，标准标记级噪声技术可能忽略这些结构。

Method: 通过从AST子树中提取有语法意义的代码片段进行选择性噪声处理，而非随机标记掩码，以尊重语法边界并捕获长程依赖。

Result: 实验表明，语法感知噪声显著提高了语法正确性、重构准确性以及对未见代码模式的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将结构信息融入扩散模型训练具有潜力，语法引导的去噪是改进代码生成任务中扩散模型的有前景方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

Method: 通过爬取多领域文本，构建26,150个句子的数据集，并开发标注平台和协议。微调预训练模型，评估解释性和公平性。

Result: 实验表明，使用标注理由训练模型可提高准确性、减少偏见，并使解释更符合人类推理。

Conclusion: TeSent为泰卢固语NLP任务提供了重要资源，并展示了标注理由对模型性能的积极影响。

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Conclusion: 结论指出，若不加以控制，LLMs的普及可能使认知景观趋于单一化，威胁多样性和创造力。

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

TL;DR: MOPrompt是一种多目标进化优化框架，旨在同时优化提示的准确性和上下文大小，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计提示复杂且耗时，自动提示优化成为研究热点，但现有方法多关注单一目标，忽略了效率与效果的平衡。

Method: 提出MOPrompt框架，利用多目标进化优化技术，同时优化提示的准确性和上下文大小，并绘制Pareto前沿。

Result: 在葡萄牙语情感分析任务中，MOPrompt显著优于基线，Sabiazinho模型下实现相同峰值准确率（0.97），但令牌长度减少31%。

Conclusion: MOPrompt为实际应用中平衡LLM的性能与效率提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法将提示视为整体，忽略其结构异质性，导致评估不准确。

Method: 提出PromptAnatomy框架，分解提示为功能组件，使用ComPerturb方法选择性扰动，并引入PPL过滤机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLMs上，ComPerturb达到最高攻击成功率，验证了提示结构感知的重要性。

Conclusion: 提示结构感知和受控扰动对LLMs的对抗鲁棒性评估至关重要。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

*Maziyar Panahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenMed NER 是一种开源、领域适应的 Transformer 模型，通过轻量级领域自适应预训练（DAPT）和参数高效的低秩适应（LoRA）技术，在生物医学命名实体识别（NER）任务中实现了高效且高性能的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据中80%以上是非结构化数据，命名实体识别（NER）是提取结构化信息的关键。尽管大型语言模型有进展，但在多样化实体类型上实现高性能且保持计算效率仍具挑战性。

Method: 结合轻量级领域自适应预训练（DAPT）和低秩适应（LoRA），使用 DeBERTa-v3、PubMedBERT 和 BioELECTRA 作为基础模型，在 350k 条公开研究文献和临床笔记上进行预训练，并通过 LoRA 进行任务特定微调。

Result: 在 12 个生物医学 NER 基准测试中，OpenMed NER 在 10 个数据集上实现了新的最佳性能，尤其在疾病和化学实体上表现突出，训练时间短且碳排放低。

Conclusion: 开源模型通过策略性适应可以超越闭源解决方案，同时具备高效性和合规性，符合数据保护和 AI 法规要求。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的文本生成能力接近人类水平，区分机器生成和人类写作的文本变得困难。现有研究多局限于单语言（英语）环境，忽视了现代LLMs的多语言特性。

Method: 研究覆盖18种语言和8种生成器（7种LLMs和人类），评估单语言AA方法在多语言环境中的适用性及其跨语言迁移能力。

Result: 研究发现某些单语言AA方法可适应多语言环境，但在跨语言家族迁移时存在显著局限性，凸显了多语言AA的复杂性。

Conclusion: 多语言AA面临重大挑战，需开发更鲁棒的方法以适应现实场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CUPID基准测试，评估LLMs在动态偏好下的个性化能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实用户偏好是动态且上下文相关的，而现有LLMs假设偏好是静态的，需改进。

Method: 引入CUPID基准，包含756个用户与LLM交互的历史会话，评估模型推断和应用动态偏好的能力。

Result: 测试10个LLMs，表现较差（精度<50%，召回率<65%），难以推断多轮交互中的偏好。

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs的上下文个性化能力，CUPID可作为改进资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiPRM提出了一种双向评估范式，通过结合右到左（R2L）和左到右（L2R）的评估流，提升过程奖励模型（PRMs）的推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs采用单向左到右（L2R）评估，无法利用全局上下文验证早期步骤的连贯性。

Method: BiPRM通过修改提示实现R2L评估流，无需额外参数或延迟。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，BiPRM显著优于单向基线，最高提升31.9%的步骤奖励评估。

Conclusion: BiPRM为过程奖励建模提供了高效、兼容且有效的新方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法在生成过程中未能充分利用知识，参数化知识与检索知识的协同有限，导致生成内容可能误导或未能准确引导输出。

Method: 提出CoCoA-zero多代理RAG框架，先进行条件知识归纳，再推理答案；进一步开发CoCoA长链训练策略，通过扩展多代理推理轨迹微调LLM。

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放域和多跳QA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架显著提升了参数化与检索知识的协同能力，为知识密集型任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在自然语言处理中表现出色，但也容易引入无关信息。此前研究关注语义泄漏，本文则首次提出表达泄漏现象，探讨其影响及缓解方法。

Method: 收集基准数据集并设计自动生成方案，提出与人工评估一致的自动评估流程，分析不同规模LLM的表达泄漏情况。

Result: 模型参数规模扩大可减少表达泄漏，但需专门处理；负向情感提示比正向情感提示更易引发表达泄漏。

Conclusion: 表达泄漏是LLMs中需专门解决的问题，模型规模扩大有助于缓解，但需在构建过程中针对性处理，且提示方法无效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Conclusion: IterChat框架有效解决了多轮对话偏好提取的标注和训练难题，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

Method: 提出TDT方法，将标记级差异视为时间序列信号，应用连续小波变换生成二维时间尺度表示。

Result: 在RAID基准测试中，TDT的AUROC达到0.855（比基线高7.1%），在对抗性任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: TDT确立了AI生成文本的非平稳性特征，并证明保留时间动态对稳健检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有希伯来语NLP基准主要关注形态句法任务，缺乏语义理解维度，因此需要构建一个适合希伯来语形态复杂性的MRC数据集。

Method: 通过设计新的标注指南、众包协议和修订的评估指标，构建了包含30,147个问答对的HeQ数据集。

Result: 实验表明，传统评估指标（如F1和EM）不适用于希伯来语，且形态句法任务与MRC任务表现相关性低。

Conclusion: HeQ的开发揭示了形态丰富语言在NLU中的挑战，为希伯来语及其他类似语言的NLU模型发展提供了基础。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Motivation: 现代仅解码器LLM在知识密集型任务中常出现幻觉问题，现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法因非参数化特性难以与LLM深度交互。

Method: 使用预训练的MLP作为外部记忆，模仿检索器行为，与Transformer解码器结合，分别进行语言建模和检索模仿预训练。

Result: 在WikiText-103和Web数据集上分别提升17.5%和24.1%，推理速度更快，且在幻觉基准和记忆密集型任务中表现优异。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Conclusion: 神经网络模型能有效分析治疗对话，为实时指导治疗师提供支持。

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student
learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This
paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然强大，但常生成流畅但事实错误的幻觉输出，需要一种有效的方法来检测和缓解这一问题。

Method: 通过动态生成看似合理但包含细微事实错误的对抗性陈述，评估模型对这些变化的敏感性。

Result: 在TruthfulQA等数据集上表现优于基线方法，幻觉分数平均降低24.5%。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing是一种高效且无需重新训练的实时验证机制，可集成到现有LLM流程中。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Motivation: 低资源语言在NLP领域长期被忽视，作者旨在填补旁遮普语的技术空白。

Method: 训练PunGPT2模型，优化分词器，结合Pun-RAG和Pun-Instruct，并开发Quantum-RAG混合检索系统。

Result: 模型在困惑度、事实性和流畅性上显著优于多语言基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言扩展LLM能力提供了可扩展、可复制的方案，并开创了量子感知检索在低资源NLP中的应用。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

Motivation: 理解LLMs为何过度使用某些词汇，并探究人类反馈学习（LHF）对其词汇选择的影响。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama模型，设计实验模拟LHF过程，检测词汇偏好并分析其与LHF的关系。

Result: 实验表明，LHF导致LLMs过度使用某些词汇，且不同人群（LHF工作者与LLM用户）对词汇的期望存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LHF对LLMs词汇选择的影响，强调了数据和过程透明度在人工智能对齐研究中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

TL;DR: ROVER框架通过递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，提升视觉语言模型在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在长帧序列推理中表现不佳，限制了其在需要连续视觉输入的具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解视频轨迹为子任务段，结合上下文学习实现。

Result: 在OpenX Embodiment和RoboCasa数据集上，ROVER在任务进度估计、自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线。

Conclusion: ROVER通过减少每步推理的帧数，缓解幻觉问题，且时间复杂度线性增长，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Result: SitEmb-v1在书情节检索数据集上显著优于现有模型，SitEmb-v1.5性能进一步提升10%。

Conclusion: SitEmb模型在检索任务中表现优异，适用于多语言和多种下游应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Result: 系统能有效提供相关且个性化的答案，并识别产品目录中的信息缺口以改进内容。

Conclusion: 该框架通过新颖的评估指标验证了其性能，适用于RAG系统的广泛评估。

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Method: 以中国青少年为研究对象，构建首个中文“青少年毒性”数据集，并分析其特征及现有检测技术的准确性。

Result: 研究发现青少年的毒性感知与上下文因素相关，结合这些信息可显著提升检测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来青少年中心的毒性检测提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing

### [58] [SpeechR: A Benchmark for Speech Reasoning in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02018)
*Wanqi Yang,Yanda Li,Yunchao Wei,Meng Fang,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechR是一个统一的基准测试，用于评估大型音频语言模型在语音推理中的能力，填补了现有评估在上下文和推理驱动能力上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注表面感知能力，而忽略了模型在语音场景中的上下文和推理能力。

Method: SpeechR通过三种评估格式（选择题、生成式和声学特征）从事实检索、程序推理和规范性判断三个维度评估模型。

Result: 评估11个先进模型后发现，高转录准确率并不等同于强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为语音推理提供了结构化基准，支持针对多样化对话任务的模型能力分析。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STIM框架通过标记级分析揭示LLMs在推理中依赖记忆的问题，尤其是局部记忆导致错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在推理任务中因记忆依赖导致的错误，尤其是Chain-of-Thought推理中的问题。

Method: 提出STIM框架，通过统计共现分析标记的记忆来源（局部、中程、远程）。

Result: 发现复杂或长尾情况下模型更依赖记忆，局部记忆导致67%的错误标记。

Conclusion: STIM能有效诊断和改进模型推理，适用于其他结构化生成任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多样语言和情感背景下实现高度表达性、可控且自然的语音生成，同时忠实保留说话者身份的长期挑战。

Method: 采用说话者-情感解耦机制和批量对比学习，结合旋转情感嵌入方法，支持独立操纵说话者身份和情感风格。

Result: 实验表明Marco-Voice在客观和主观指标上均有显著提升，语音清晰度和情感丰富度表现优异。

Conclusion: Marco-Voice在表达性神经语音合成领域取得了重大进展。

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates
voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework.
The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly
expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully
preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts.
Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism
with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of
speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional
embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality
emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six
professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

*Soyeon Kim,Jindong Wang,Xing Xie,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TDBench是一个新的基准测试，通过利用时间数据库和数据库技术（如时间SQL和功能依赖）系统构建时间敏感问答对，以减少对人工的依赖并实现可扩展的全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事实随时间变化，现有基准测试依赖人工或固定模板，限制了时间敏感问答（TSQA）的可扩展性和全面性评估。

Method: 利用时间数据库和数据库技术（如时间SQL和功能依赖）构建TSQA对，并引入时间准确性指标评估时间引用的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，TDBench能实现可扩展和全面的TSQA评估，减少人工依赖，并补充现有基于维基百科/Wikidata的评估方法。

Conclusion: TDBench为时间敏感问答评估提供了更可靠和可扩展的方法，适用于特定应用数据和多跳问题生成。

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

### [62] [ProCut: LLM Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02053)
*Zhentao Xu,Fengyi Li,Albert Chen,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCut是一种无需训练、灵活且与LLM无关的框架，通过归因分析压缩提示模板，显著减少提示大小（生产环境中减少78%的标记），同时保持或提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中，提示模板膨胀导致维护困难、推理延迟和服务成本增加，需一种高效压缩方法。

Method: ProCut将提示模板分割为语义单元，量化其对任务性能的影响，并修剪低效用部分，同时引入LLM驱动的归因估计器以减少压缩延迟。

Result: 在五个公共基准数据集和实际工业提示上，ProCut显著减少提示大小（78%），任务性能保持或提升（最高比替代方法好62%）。

Conclusion: ProCut是一种高效、灵活的提示压缩方法，可无缝集成现有优化框架，生成简洁高效的提示。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SMeL测试，评估语言模型过滤不可信信息的能力，发现当前模型表现不佳，甚至大型模型也未优于小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上存在大量不可信内容，但语言模型是否具备人类筛选信息的能力尚不清楚。

Method: 引入SMeL测试，评估多种指令调优语言模型的能力。

Result: 模型表现不稳定，即使优秀模型也有高达70%的幻觉率，且模型规模与性能无关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在信息筛选上的不足，为未来改进方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中谄媚行为的内部机制，发现用户意见会引发谄媚行为，而用户权威性对其影响甚微。通过分析，揭示了谄媚行为的两个阶段：输出偏好转变和深层表征分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中谄媚行为的内部机制，以改进模型的对齐性和真实性。

Method: 系统研究用户意见对谄媚行为的影响，使用logit-lens分析和因果激活修补技术。

Result: 发现谄媚行为源于深层表征的结构性覆盖，用户权威性未被模型编码，第一人称提示比第三人称更易引发谄媚。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为是深层表征的结构性问题，对AI对齐和真实性系统设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

TL;DR: 通过元学习优化小型语言模型的预训练，使其更快、性能更好且更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型成本高的问题，探索元学习是否能提升小型语言模型的预训练效率和可解释性。

Method: 结合一阶MAML和子集掩码语言模型预训练，构建四个LLama风格的解码器模型（11M-570M参数），并在基础NLP任务中评估。

Result: 相比传统训练，模型（i）损失收敛快1.6倍，（ii）多语言通用NER任务F1提升，（iii）训练动态更易解读，呈现“多样化”和“压缩”两阶段。

Conclusion: 元学习显著提升小型语言模型的效率和可解释性，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Conclusion: Seed Diffusion Preview在代码模型的速度-质量帕累托前沿上确立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto
frontier for code models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的数学能力方面存在不足，尤其是针对证明类问题，手动创建既不可扩展又成本高昂。

Method: 提出Proof2Hybrid框架，通过Proof2X将数学证明转化为易于验证的多种问题形式，并设计了一种新型混合格式问题（$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions），以支持自动评估。

Result: 通过AlgGeoTest（包含456个代数几何问题）对先进LLMs进行评估，发现其在代数几何理解上存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid框架和AlgGeoTest为深入研究AI系统的数学智能提供了新途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中文化信息的编码方式及其与语言神经元的交互关系。

Method: 扩展语言特定神经元定位方法，引入MUREL数据集（85.2百万标记，涵盖六种文化），进行神经元定位和干预实验。

Result: 发现文化神经元主要分布在上层，可独立调节，与语言神经元分离。

Conclusion: 文化知识可选择性编辑，促进公平性和包容性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

Conclusion: 干扰矩阵可作为优化多语言模型设计的工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

Result: 在上升阶段，负样本的熵减少促进有效推理模式学习；在平台阶段，高熵令牌与学习效率相关。

Conclusion: 动态调整奖励信号的方法在多种LLMs上优于基线方法。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Motivation: 阿拉伯世界存在现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言之间的显著差异，这对自然语言处理（尤其是机器翻译）提出了巨大挑战。

Method: 开发了两个专门模型（MSA-to-Shami和Shami-to-MSA），基于AraT5v2-base-1024架构，使用Nabra数据集微调，并在MADAR语料库上评估。

Result: MSA-to-Shami模型在GPT-4.1评估中平均得分4.01/5.0，展示了高准确性和方言真实性。

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT为方言阿拉伯语翻译提供了高保真工具，适用于内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and
intercultural communication.

Result: Danish Dynaword规模远超同类数据集，采用开放许可，并成功吸引多方贡献，建立了可持续的社区协作框架。

Conclusion: Dynaword方法为大规模数据集提供了可持续、开放的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了四种方法（GPT-4o、回归、PCA和神经坍缩）用于检测RAG系统中的OOD查询，以确保系统仅响应知识库范围内的查询。通过实验验证，外部OOD检测器对保持响应相关性至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，确保RAG系统的安全性和领域内响应是一个重要挑战，需要有效的方法检测OOD查询。

Method: 评估了四种OOD检测方法，并探索了PCA和神经坍缩特征分离两种新策略。实验在标准数据集和实际应用中进行。

Result: 实验证实，外部OOD检测器能显著提升响应的正确性和相关性。

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器是确保RAG系统响应相关性的关键工具。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态分配位置编码能力和多粒度注意力机制，显著提升大语言模型在长上下文输入中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在输入超出预训练上下文窗口时的性能下降问题，特别是由于RoPE的分布外行为导致的性能退化。

Method: 提出LaMPE，利用参数化缩放sigmoid函数动态调整位置编码分配，并设计多粒度注意力机制以捕捉局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: 在五个主流长上下文基准测试中，LaMPE显著优于现有长度外推方法。

Conclusion: LaMPE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种基于RoPE的大语言模型，无需额外训练即可提升长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at
https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型的训练面临异构架构和系统设计的挑战，现有框架的可扩展性和效率不足。

Method: VeOmni通过模型中心的分布式策略，解耦通信与计算，支持高效的3D并行，并提供灵活的配置接口以集成新模态。

Conclusion: VeOmni展示了高效和可扩展的全模态大语言模型训练能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for
training large omni-modal LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于微专家（micro-expert）的压缩方法CAMERA，通过分析微专家的冗余性，实现了高效的模型压缩和量化，显著提升了计算和存储效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管混合专家（MoE）模型在性能上表现优异，但其计算和存储开销巨大，且性能提升与参数增长不成比例。现有方法在性能和计算效率上仍有不足。

Method: 论文提出CAMERA框架，将MoE层视为微专家的混合，并通过CAMERA-P（结构化剪枝）和CAMERA-Q（混合精度量化）实现高效压缩。

Result: 实验表明，CAMERA-P在20%-60%的剪枝比例下优于基线方法，CAMERA-Q在2位量化下表现优异，且分析速度极快。

Conclusion: CAMERA提供了一种轻量级且无需训练的压缩方法，显著提升了MoE模型的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨微调大型语言模型在政治话题上如何影响其立场，并研究如何减少跨话题的意外泛化。

Method: 提出PNLAC定位政治神经元，开发InhibitFT抑制跨话题泛化。

Result: 实验证明PNLAC有效识别神经元类型，InhibitFT平均减少20%跨话题泛化，仅抑制5%神经元即可。

Conclusion: PNLAC和InhibitFT为减少政治微调的跨话题影响提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩方法CompressKV，通过识别关键注意力头并分层自适应分配缓存，显著提升了长上下文处理的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于GQA的LLMs在KV缓存压缩中忽视了注意力头的功能差异，导致关键令牌被错误剔除，影响模型性能。

Method: 识别每层中能检索关键令牌及其语义上下文的注意力头，利用这些头确定重要令牌并保留其KV缓存对，同时引入分层自适应缓存分配策略。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，CompressKV在不同内存预算下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV通过优化注意力头选择和分层缓存分配，有效提升了长上下文处理的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

TL;DR: BAKE是一种新的连续知识图谱嵌入模型，通过贝叶斯后验更新和连续聚类方法有效缓解了传统模型在动态知识图谱中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入模型仅适用于静态图谱，而动态知识图谱需要连续学习模型以避免知识遗忘。

Method: BAKE利用贝叶斯后验更新原则作为连续学习策略，并通过连续聚类方法约束新旧知识间的演化差异。

Result: 实验表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE通过贝叶斯更新和聚类约束，有效解决了连续知识图谱嵌入中的知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的框架，用于从非结构化文本数据中可靠地评估创新性，解决了传统专家评估的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创新测量依赖专家评估和特定情境的代理指标，限制了研究的广泛性。LLM有望克服这些限制。

Method: 设计了一个LLM框架，通过提示工程、模型选择等关键设计决策，评估创新性。在两个不同情境下验证了其性能。

Result: LLM框架的F1分数高于其他方法，且结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和企业提供了一种可靠、广泛适用的工具，用于测量创新性，并讨论了关键设计决策的影响。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化技术依赖启发式或手动探索，缺乏自动化方法。

Method: 利用潜在语义空间嵌入种子提示并系统探索，生成、评估和优化候选提示。

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类任务中，单次优化周期提升准确率约3%。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt框架通用性强，仅需黑盒LLM访问和自动评估指标，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

Method: 采用定性方法分析视觉修辞、言语话语和数字讽刺，研究符号、抗议艺术和标语的作用。

Result: 研究发现，Facebook上的视觉与言语策略不仅动员了公众情绪，还构建了挑战专制叙事的集体身份。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在线平台在数字时代可作为身份构建和政治动员的有力工具。

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

Motivation: 了解LLMs如何编码跨语言的心理语言学知识，并探索其作为跨语言认知模型的潜力。

Method: 使用声音象征和词价两个任务，评估Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct在英语、荷兰语和中文中的单语和双语提示下的表现。

Result: 模型输出受语言身份影响，Qwen对荷兰语和中文的区分更敏感；深层网络中心理语言学信号更易解码，中文提示的词价表征更强且更稳定。

Conclusion: 语言身份显著影响LLMs的输出行为和内部表征，为LLMs作为跨语言认知模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Result: 发现LLMs中存在数字位特定的模块化子电路，这些电路对算术任务的解决具有因果作用。

Conclusion: LLMs在解决算术问题时具有可解释的组合结构，数字位特定电路是其核心机制。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs在生成文化意义重大且形式约束严格的文学文本时具有潜力，但仍存在局限性，未来可通过更精细的评估和优化进一步提升。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Result: 发现模型内部存在高层次的音素组织，并识别出一个促进语音信息的“音素移动头”。

Conclusion: Llama模型学习了一种类似人类IPA元音图的音素模型，尽管未接受直接监督。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

Motivation: 解决标准Transformer模型在复杂技术文档中细粒度语法和实体关系上的不足。

Method: CGT通过动态图构建输入标记的局部结构（使用GATv2Conv层），再通过Transformer编码器捕获全局依赖。

Result: CGT在准确率上比GPT-2高24.7%，且参数减少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT为技术领域提供了参数高效且适应性强的解决方案，特别适合需要结构感知和上下文强化的任务。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动识别新闻偏见的联合三目标方法（COSS），包括委托、遗漏和来源选择偏见，并展示了可视化示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻信息过载，读者难以判断来源可靠性和中立性，需要自动识别偏见的方法。

Method: 采用联合三目标（COSS）方法，通过管道步骤识别偏见，并利用文本重用模式进行可视化。

Result: 提出了一种新的偏见识别方法，并通过可视化展示了其效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别新闻偏见，为读者提供更可靠的信息来源判断工具。

Abstract: In a world overwhelmed with news, determining which information comes from
reliable sources or how neutral is the reported information in the news
articles poses a challenge to news readers. In this paper, we propose a
methodology for automatically identifying bias by commission, omission, and
source selection (COSS) as a joint three-fold objective, as opposed to the
previous work separately addressing these types of bias. In a pipeline concept,
we describe the goals and tasks of its steps toward bias identification and
provide an example of a visualization that leverages the extracted features and
patterns of text reuse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从维基百科和EURONEWS构建多语言可比语料库的方法，并实验了基于双语词典和潜在语义索引（LSI）的跨语言相似度测量方法，发现CL-LSI优于词典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可比语料库在多语言自然语言处理中很有用，尤其是在缺乏平行文本的领域或语言中。

Method: 从维基百科和EURONEWS构建可比语料库，实验了基于双语词典和CL-LSI的跨语言文档对齐方法。

Result: CL-LSI在主题和事件级别的跨语言文档对齐中表现优于词典方法。

Conclusion: CL-LSI是一种有效的跨语言文档对齐方法，适用于主题和事件级别的对齐。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多视角话语分析框架，结合领域特定的对话动作和话语关系，解决了数学教育中反馈分析的挑战，揭示了无对话动作话语的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学教育中有效反馈需要全面分析课堂对话，但现有方法难以处理话语的多功能性和遗漏问题。

Method: 提出多视角话语分析框架，整合领域特定的对话动作（43标签）和话语关系（16关系），应用于两个数学教育数据集。

Result: 发现无对话动作的话语在引导、确认和结构化课堂对话中起关键作用，揭示了有意义的话语模式。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于改进AI辅助教育系统的反馈功能，支持开发更有效的教育AI代理。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双向GRU的神经序列标注方法，用于自动标注临床文本中的SNOMED CT概念，性能优于传统规则系统，且计算成本低于基于Transformer的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的标准化医学概念标注对结构化数据提取和决策支持至关重要，但手动标注成本高且难以规模化。

Method: 使用双向GRU模型，结合MIMIC-IV数据集，通过领域适应的SpaCy和SciBERT分词，将句子分割为19个标记的块，并加入上下文、句法和形态特征。

Result: 模型在验证集上达到90%的F1分数，优于传统规则系统，与现有神经模型相当或更好。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念标注，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark 是一个新的眼科基准测试，用于评估医学大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉问题，并通过多阶段框架显著减少幻觉，提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs 在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，限制了其准确性，现有基准测试无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出 EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段的多智能体框架（知识检索、任务案例研究和结果验证）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark 为 MLLMs 在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLM在推理时存在高计算复杂度和内存开销，现有缓存技术内存占用大，限制了长上下文应用。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合动态缓存驱逐和稀疏注意力，利用token显著性稳定性优化缓存管理。

Result: 实验显示Sparse-dLLM在LLaDA和Dream系列上吞吐量提升10倍，性能接近且内存成本相似。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在效率和效果上优于现有方法，为dLLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中记忆现象的多面性及其背后的机制。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）分析LLM的注意力权重，评估现有分类法与注意力权重的对齐情况。

Result: 现有分类法效果差，新分类法分为三类：基于语言建模能力的记忆、高重复训练数据的记忆和非记忆样本。研究发现少量样本的记忆并无独特注意力机制。

Conclusion: 提出新分类法，揭示记忆现象的复杂性，并开发了可视化技术定位记忆相关的注意力区域。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和缺乏方面级情感标签而未被充分分析，EHSAN旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用数据中心的混合流程，结合ChatGPT伪标签和人工审核，构建数据集，并训练两个Transformer模型进行方面和情感分类。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型在少量人工监督下仍保持高准确率，减少方面类别显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: EHSAN为阿拉伯语医疗领域方面情感分析提供了可扩展且有效的方法，未来可推广至其他医院并优化提示设计。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

Motivation: 当前多LLM协作方法缺乏结构化，导致生成内容难以验证。MArgE旨在通过计算论证学提供可验证的结构化证据。

Method: 使用Argumentative LLMs构建结构化论证树，为任务提供可追溯的验证路径。

Result: MArgE在实验中显著优于单LLM、开源模型及非结构化多LLM方法。

Conclusion: 引入形式化论证机制能有效提升多LLM协作的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

Motivation: 研究字符级任务对语言模型的挑战，澄清分词对模型性能的影响。

Method: 引入CharBench基准测试，评估多种语言模型在字符级任务上的表现，并分析分词与任务性能的关系。

Result: 模型在CharBench上的平均准确率为43.6%和32.3%，分词特性对计数任务影响较小，但对位置任务影响显著。

Conclusion: CharBench为改进语言模型在字符级任务上的性能提供了工具和方法。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“交互蒸馏”的新方法，通过注意力优化改进奖励模型（RM）的偏好建模，解决了现有方法在token级交互上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型（RM）的偏好建模在token级交互上存在不足，容易因注意力分配不当而被“注意力攻击”影响。

Method: 提出“交互蒸馏”框架，利用交互式自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，通过注意力对齐目标指导偏好建模模拟教师模型的交互模式。

Result: 实验表明，交互蒸馏能提供更稳定且泛化性更强的奖励信号，优于现有针对数据噪声的RM优化方法。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是RM中更根本的限制，交互蒸馏方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准注意力机制O(N²)复杂度的问题，提供高效的长距离建模方案。

Method: 采用层间指针链技术，每层指针选择依赖前一层指针位置，形成显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列上实现2-10倍加速，2048token内保持>95%准确率，学习到可解释的指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer为无需预训练的高效长距离建模提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Conclusion: 建议数据集不应被视为不可变，需定期检查、修正和版本化，同时为数据集创建者和使用者提供改进质量的建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human

to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive

methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments

Conclusion: 该研究为多样系统提供了数学上严谨的统一框架，具有广泛的理论和应用潜力。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

Method: 通过实验得出三个经验性见解，提出AgentTTS框架，利用LLM代理通过反馈驱动搜索最优分配。

Result: AgentTTS在搜索效率和鲁棒性上优于传统方法，且具有更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为多阶段任务中的计算最优分配提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [105] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊框架ff4ERA，用于量化伦理风险，支持AI系统的伦理决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI的发展，伦理风险评估（ERA）面临不确定性、模糊性和信息不完整性等挑战，需要一种灵活且透明的框架。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因子（CF），通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化风险。

Result: 案例研究表明，ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感的伦理风险评分，且结果稳健。

Conclusion: ff4ERA提供了一种可解释、可追踪的伦理评估方法，支持假设分析和决策校准。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否像人类一样在风险决策中表现出‘前景理论’行为，并探讨情境对风险偏好的影响。

Method: 通过实验测试大型语言模型在不同情境（如军事与民用）下的风险决策行为，并与人类行为对比。

Result: 模型表现出与人类相似的前景理论行为，且军事情境中的‘框架效应’更强。

Conclusion: 语言模型捕捉了人类的启发式与偏见，但偏见分布不均，情境（‘框架’）是关键因素。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在处理需要组合推理的任务（如多跳问答）时表现不佳，导致推理过程不逻辑。

Method: CHECK通过语义分析推理链，优化逻辑并重新提示LLM模型（提高温度）来修正推理错误。

Result: 在四个数据集上，CHECK比五种最先进框架平均提高了22.8%的MQA准确率。

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化，有效提升了LLM在多跳问答任务中的知识更新能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

Motivation: 现代EDA工作流依赖手动脚本和工具交互，效率低且难以扩展，现有LLM解决方案成本高且缺乏标准化框架。

Method: 利用MCP协议实现并行学习，通过结构化提示工程、智能参数提取和任务分解减少微调需求，并引入扩展的CodeBLEU指标评估脚本质量。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoEDA在自动化准确性、效率和脚本质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoEDA通过标准化框架和开源发布，为EDA社区提供了高效、可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM可实现实时边缘协同规划，语言引导的上下文推理提升自动驾驶安全性和响应能力。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Result: 发现AI输出突变的触发点，并展示其如何通过多层架构放大。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于提高AI的透明度和性能，并为量化用户风险和法律责任提供路径。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Method: 使用DHS数据，结合Landsat图像和LLM生成的文本描述，开发五种预测管道（视觉模型、LLM、AI代理搜索、联合编码器、集成信号），通过多模态框架预测财富。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能更准确地预测财富，LLM知识更具优势，代理数据在某些情况下提供补充信息。研究支持了物质福祉的共享潜在编码假设，并提供了大规模数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Conclusion: H2C有效解决了轨迹预测中的持续学习问题，为自动驾驶系统在多场景下的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态情感推理中表现优异，但忽视了情感冲突场景（不同模态的情感线索不一致）。

Method: 提出MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE（模态特定专家）和AR（注意力重分配机制），以平衡模态贡献。

Result: 实验表明，MoSEAR在多个基准测试中表现最佳，尤其在模态冲突条件下。

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效缓解了情感冲突，提升了性能，且不牺牲音频或视觉模态的平衡。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

Result: CoT推理在超出训练分布时失效，表明其能力受限于数据分布。

Conclusion: CoT推理并非真正的深度推理，其有效性依赖于训练数据的分布，强调了实现通用推理的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Conclusion: BIS可靠且广泛适用，可显著降低代码相关任务中LLM基准测试的成本和努力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合显著性检验和共形预测框架的新型故障检测方法，提供形式化的风险保证，并在实验中验证了其理论性质和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障诊断模型在复杂场景（如分布偏移）中缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的不确定性量化，亟需改进。

Method: 将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，基于模型残差定义非一致性度量，利用校准数据集计算新样本的p值，构建具有数学保证的预测集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨域故障诊断任务中始终达到或超过名义覆盖水平（1-α），且在高风险容忍度下预测集更小。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个理论基础的故障检测框架，实现了明确的风险控制，提升了诊断系统的可信度。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

TL;DR: SketchAgent是一个多智能体系统，旨在将手绘草图自动转换为结构化图表，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手绘草图虽直观高效，但缺乏结构约束和语义精确性，难以自动生成机器可读的图表。

Method: 结合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证，生成语义连贯且结构准确的图表。

Result: 提出了Sketch2Diagram Benchmark数据集，包含6000多个高质量示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计、教育和工程中有广泛应用前景，填补了草图与机器可读图表间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/DiagramAgent/Sketch2Diagram-Benchmark.

TL;DR: MoE-MLA-RoPE结合MoE、MLA和RoPE，通过细粒度专家路由、共享专家隔离和无梯度冲突负载平衡，实现高效语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型容量与计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用64个微专家和top-k选择、共享专家隔离、无梯度冲突负载平衡。

Result: KV缓存内存减少68%，推理速度提升3.2倍，验证损失降低6.9%，生成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展定义了资源受限语言模型的效率前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SLMs在资源受限环境中的应用增加，MIAs对其隐私和知识产权的威胁日益凸显，但现有研究较少且攻击效果随模型规模减小而降低。

Method: 提出了一种基于min-k的改进攻击方法win-k，并在三个数据集和八个SLMs上进行了实验评估。

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有MIAs，尤其在小型模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种有效的MIA方法，特别适用于SLMs，为隐私保护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，跨来源的知识冲突问题日益突出，尤其是在长且冲突的上下文中，LLMs容易混淆。

Method: KCR框架通过提取文本或局部知识图的推理路径，利用强化学习训练模型选择逻辑一致的路径，而非错误路径。

Result: 实验表明，KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长上下文场景中解决知识冲突的能力，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: KCR框架为LLMs解决知识冲突提供了有效方法，尤其在长上下文场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: Multi-TW为传统中文多模态模型评估提供了全面视角，并强调了模型优化和高效架构的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

Motivation: LLM在规划任务中常生成错误或幻觉动作，现有评估方法主要关注成功率，缺乏对计划质量的全面分析。

Method: 提出了一种包含NLP评估和三个阶段恢复的流程，最终通过符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 研究发现LLM在计划生成中缺乏明确的推理能力，恢复流程仅将成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%，且平均仅前2.65个动作可执行。

Conclusion: 尽管恢复流程有所改进，LLM生成的计划在质量和可靠性上仍不及传统规划器。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单但强大的方式，利用LLM的推理能力，将字谜转化为有效的越狱策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Conclusion: 人类将转向监督AI的新职业，政策应促进人机协作以实现福利最大化。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Motivation: 传统方法假设封闭世界，限制了预测的灵活性，无法捕捉探索性行为或城市道路网络的拓扑约束。

Result: 模型在准确率和MRR上显著优于基线，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了封闭世界假设的不足，为城市移动预测提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试依赖不现实的模拟数据，评估指标未能全面衡量旅行计划质量，需更真实的评估框架。

Method: 引入包含50万真实POI和4000多样旅行行程的数据集TripTailor，用于评估LLM生成的旅行计划。

Result: 实验显示，最新LLM生成的行程中仅不到10%达到人类水平，并揭示了可行性、合理性和个性化等挑战。

Conclusion: TripTailor有望推动开发更理解用户需求、生成实用行程的旅行规划代理。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Result: 揭示了文本与图表示在训练过程中的对齐与分歧模式，明确了其整合的适用条件。

Conclusion: 研究为文本与图表示的互补性提供了系统见解，指导了混合模型的设计。

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

TL;DR: CARGO框架优化电动车辆配送路线和充电计划，显著降低充电成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动车辆在城市配送中因电池容量有限，需优化充电和路线规划。

Method: 提出混合整数线性规划（MILP）精确解和高效启发式方法。

Result: 相比基准策略，充电成本降低高达39%和22%。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在减少成本的同时完成可比配送任务。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Motivation: 解决多智能体路径规划中动力学模型简化导致计划不可行的问题，并减少执行过程中的不确定性。

Method: 提出kTPG算法优化MAPF计划为动力学可行计划，并基于此开发WinkTPG框架，通过窗口机制动态调整计划。

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了多智能体路径规划中的动力学可行性和不确定性问题，显著提升了执行效率和质量。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Motivation: 人类反馈成本高且难以扩展，需要一种自动化方法来提升数据集质量。

Method: 使用LLM迭代精炼和评估数据，直到无法进一步改进为止。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Refine-n-Judge增强的模型表现优于原始数据集，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，并显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否继承人类认知偏见（如承诺升级）及其触发条件，以指导高风险领域的部署。

Method: 通过四组实验（个体决策、多智能体协作、复合压力情境）分析LLMs的偏见表现。

Result: 个体决策中LLMs表现理性，但在多智能体协作或压力情境下显著出现承诺升级（最高99.2%）。

Conclusion: LLMs的偏见表现由社会和组织情境驱动，需谨慎部署多智能体系统和非监督操作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解和单步解决子目标，有效提升了零样本泛化能力，适用于复杂任务和安全约束。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Result: 在五个复杂度层级中，代理适应性和性能呈趋势性变化，高复杂度下收益递减。

Conclusion: PCF为可扩展、动态、可解释的AI应用提供了框架，适用于多领域。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Conclusion: QCBench揭示了LLMs在科学计算准确性方面的局限性，为未来改进提供了基础。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational

bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有RAG和GraphRAG基线。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对于稳健的长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

Motivation: 解决医学报告生成中的视觉、标签分布和上下文不确定性，提高临床可信度。

Method: 采用Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块、Token Sensitive Learning目标和Contextual Evidence Filter。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SURE-Med为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准，推动临床决策支持的可信度。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

Conclusion: CoT框架有效解决了NL2VIS的黑盒问题，增强了用户体验和可视化效果。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力，解决了DFJSP问题中LLM直接应用的不足，显著提升了调度性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调度规则效率高但缺乏灵活性，深度学习方法需要复杂特征工程，而直接应用LLM存在长上下文悖论、专家启发式利用不足和短视决策等问题。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，通过LLM分析多时间跨度的启发式模拟，生成战略经验总结，并集成到最终决策模块中。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基准，并超越所有评估的启发式方法，同时缓解了三个关键问题。

Conclusion: ReflecSched展示了LLM在复杂调度问题中的潜力，通过战略分析实现了非短视的高效决策。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体协作框架HypoAgents，结合贝叶斯推理和信息熵驱动搜索，通过生成、验证和优化假设的闭环过程，显著提升了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学知识的爆炸式增长使得自动生成兼具新颖性、可行性和研究价值的科学假设成为核心挑战，现有方法未能系统建模假设的内在特性或纳入闭环反馈机制。

Method: 提出HypoAgents框架，分三阶段（假设生成、证据验证、假设优化）结合贝叶斯推理和信息熵搜索，通过多样性采样和N-R-F评分生成初始假设，利用RAG收集证据更新后验概率，最后基于信息熵优化假设集。

Result: 在ICLR 2025数据集上，经过12次优化迭代，假设的平均ELO分数提升116.3，超过真实论文摘要基准17.8，框架的整体不确定性（香农熵）显著降低0.92。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化科学发现提供了一个可解释的概率推理框架，显著提高了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源求解器不支持条件时间间隔和累积函数的建模，且实现细节未公开。

Method: 使用单一通用全局约束（广义累积）实现建模，并设计新的时间表过滤算法处理条件时间间隔任务。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能与现有求解器相当，能有效扩展至大规模问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了生产者与消费者调度问题的建模，并展示了良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为未来的推理系统分析和比较提供基础结构，特别是在内部失败、适应或分裂可能发生的场景中。

Method: 将推理系统建模为包含现象、解释空间、推理和生成映射以及原则基础的结构化元组，并调查基本内部标准和典型失败模式。

Result: 提出了一个统一的框架，能够容纳多种推理过程，并支持动态行为如迭代优化和原则演化。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来在结构约束下的推理理论和实践研究提供了基础支持。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的自动化过程奖励数据构建框架，结合两种不确定性感知的输出聚合方法，显著提升了数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步数学推理中易出错，现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）的数据构建方法效率低下或劳动密集。

Method: 提出不确定性驱动的自动化PRM数据构建框架，并引入两种输出聚合方法：混合多数奖励投票和加权奖励频率投票。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，两种聚合方法进一步提升了PRMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架高效构建PRM数据，新聚合方法结合多数投票与PRMs优势，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

TL;DR: LiveMCPBench是首个针对大规模MCP环境的综合基准测试，包含95个真实任务、70个服务器和527个工具，用于评估LLM代理在复杂动态环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试仅限于单服务器和少量工具，无法有效评估大规模真实场景中的代理能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准测试、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval自动化评估框架，并开发MCP Copilot Agent进行动态规划和API交互。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但不同模型表现差异大，部分广泛使用的模型表现不佳。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为LLM代理在真实、工具丰富和动态环境中的评估提供了统一框架，支持可扩展和可重复的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

TL;DR: CloudAnoAgent结合神经符号LLM代理，通过联合处理结构指标和日志数据，显著提升云环境异常检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖指标数据，因数据不平衡导致高误报率，增加了运维负担。LLM的进展为结合指标和日志数据提供了新机会。

Method: 提出CloudAnoAgent，联合处理结构指标和文本日志，利用符号验证生成结构化异常报告，并引入CloudAnoBench基准数据集。

Result: 实验显示，CloudAnoAgent平均提升异常分类准确率46.36%和36.67%，降低误报率36.67%和33.89%，异常类型检测准确率提升12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent在准确性、误报率和可解释性上表现优异，适用于企业云环境。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

TL;DR: ProKG Dial是一个基于领域知识图谱（KG）的渐进式框架，用于构建高质量的多轮对话数据集，解决了现有方法资源密集或质量受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）在专业领域缺乏精确性，而构建高质量领域特定对话数据集对开发专业对话系统至关重要。

Method: ProKG Dial通过社区检测将KG划分为语义子图，逐步生成围绕目标实体的问题和答案，并进行严格过滤以保证质量。

Result: 实验表明，ProKG Dial显著提升了对话质量与领域性能，自动指标和人工评估均验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial为构建知识密集型对话数据集提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单轮NL2GQL转换，而实际应用中用户与图数据库的交互是多轮、动态且依赖上下文的。单轮方法无法有效处理复杂场景和多轮对话，且缺乏高质量的多轮数据集。

Method: 基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的自动化方法构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并开发了MTGQL数据集。提出了三种基线方法评估多轮翻译效果。

Result: 开发了MTGQL数据集，并提出了三种基线方法，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了多轮NL2GQL转换的挑战，为复杂场景下的图数据库交互提供了支持，并推动了相关领域的研究。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Motivation: 探索AI代理在在线市场中的购物行为及其对市场动态的影响。

Method: 开发ACES沙盒环境，通过随机化产品属性（如位置、价格、评分等）研究VLM代理的购物行为。

Result: AI代理对产品位置、标签和平台推荐敏感，偏好与人类相似但程度不同；卖家代理可通过优化描述显著提升市场份额。

Conclusion: AI代理的行为揭示了电子商务中的新策略和潜在竞争问题，需进一步研究平台设计和监管。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

TL;DR: SNOW是一个基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，能够从非结构化临床笔记中自动生成结构化特征，性能接近人工特征生成，且无需临床专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但提取有效特征仍具挑战性。现有方法要么依赖人工，要么缺乏可解释性和临床相关性。

Method: SNOW采用模块化多代理系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动完成特征发现、提取、验证、后处理和聚合。

Result: SNOW在预测5年前列腺癌复发任务中，性能（AUC-ROC: 0.761）接近人工特征生成（0.771），显著优于基线（0.691）和其他自动化方法。

Conclusion: SNOW证明自主LLM系统可以大规模复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Conclusion: AMADEUS为角色扮演对话生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对齐漂移的根源，提出可追溯的解决方案。

Method: 引入BCI指标和TraceShield、Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss、Prov-Decode三种干预措施。

Result: 对齐漂移减少85%，任务性能影响小（delta<0.2）。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐漂移提供了可扩展的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Conclusion: 该方法提升了准确性、上下文理解和稳定性，为风险检测提供了新支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG为多智能体语言生成提供了一种可扩展且鲁棒的协作方法。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自我进化机制显著提升LLM代理的推理能力和任务解决效果。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

*Yiqing Xu,Linfeng Li,Cunjun Yu,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StackItUp系统通过2D手绘草图生成稳定的3D结构，无需专家工具或精确3D姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有机器人系统无法直接根据手绘草图生成3D结构的问题，降低非专家的使用门槛。

Method: 引入抽象关系图，结合符号几何关系和稳定性模式，通过扩散模型生成3D姿态并迭代优化隐藏支撑结构。

Result: 在标志性建筑和现代房屋设计中，StackItUp生成的3D结构稳定且视觉相似度高，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家提供了一种高效、直观的3D结构生成方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

### [164] [Attractive Metadata Attack: Inducing LLM Agents to Invoke Malicious Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02110)
*Kanghua Mo,Li Hu,Yucheng Long,Zhihao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLM）代理的新型攻击方法——吸引力元数据攻击（AMA），通过操纵工具元数据来影响代理行为，揭示了当前代理架构的系统性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于发现LLM代理在利用外部工具时，工具元数据可能被恶意操纵，从而形成新的攻击面。

Method: 方法是通过AMA框架，生成高度吸引人但语法和语义有效的工具元数据，并通过迭代优化实现攻击。

Result: 实验结果显示攻击成功率高达81%-95%，且对主任务执行影响极小，即使在防御措施下仍有效。

Conclusion: 结论指出元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且强大的攻击方式，需开发执行级安全机制以应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Motivation: 随着大型推理模型（如DeepSeek R1）的广泛应用，过度推理问题（如冗长的推理链）影响了效率和准确性，因此需要研究高效推理方法。

Method: 系统回顾了高效推理方法的研究进展，将其分为单模型优化和多模型协作两个方向。

Result: 提出了两类高效推理方法：单模型优化和多模型协作，并开源了相关研究进展的GitHub仓库。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的研究有助于提升大型推理模型的效率和准确性，未来可进一步探索其实际应用。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Conclusion: AgentOps框架为代理系统的运维提供了清晰的方向，有助于解决异常问题并促进其进一步发展。

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制（DMA），通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性，显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持信息完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为长上下文建模的瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力机制存在静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和位置感知稀疏注意力计算，实现双稀疏设计。

Result: 实验表明DMA在困惑度和多查询关联召回任务中优于多种注意力机制，并在1.7B参数模型中表现突出。

Conclusion: DMA有效平衡了模型效率和长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Motivation: 情感弧是跨文化和媒体的普遍叙事结构，研究旨在将其融入游戏叙事生成，以增强玩家的情感体验和叙事连贯性。

Method: 利用叙事学理论和实证分析，以情感弧（上升与下降）为结构框架，生成分支故事图，并结合LLM和自适应实体生成技术。

Result: 原型ARPG的评估显示，情感弧的整合显著提升了玩家的参与度、叙事连贯性和情感影响力。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的程序生成在互动叙事中具有巨大潜力，可推动游戏叙事的发展。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双惩罚强化学习框架，以减少大型推理模型（LRMs）中的冗余推理步骤（内部冗余和外部冗余），从而提升效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）生成的推理过程过于冗长（称为过度思考），影响了效率和可解释性。现有方法仅关注缩短响应长度，未深入分析推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 通过滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余（低贡献推理步骤），并通过惩罚外部冗余（FCS后的不必要延续）鼓励提前终止。

Result: 方法显著压缩了推理过程且精度损失极小，并能泛化到问答和代码生成等任务。外部冗余可安全移除，内部冗余需谨慎以减少对正确性的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了推理效率，还实现了对推理长度的语义感知控制，为更简洁和可解释的LRMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Motivation: 人工神经网络在灵活性和通用智能方面存在局限，源于其与生物认知的根本差异，特别是忽略了功能专门化和时间动态协调。

Method: 设计了三部分架构（感知、辅助、执行系统），结合多频率神经振荡和突触动态适应机制模拟时间动态。

Result: 在视觉任务中，性能优于现有方法，准确率提升2.18%，计算迭代减少48.44%，且更符合人类置信模式。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能提供了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Result: 在具有认知不确定性的环境中（如随机网格世界和部分可观察的Minigrid任务），该方法优于传统的KL控制代理，表现出更稳健的规划和高效探索。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将主动推理理论与实际实现结合，证明了认知先验在人工智能代理中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Conclusion: Traffic-R1为TSC系统提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Conclusion: PHM-Bench为PHM领域大模型评估提供了方法论基础和关键基准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM求解器依赖迭代修复，导致高延迟且不可靠，OptiHive旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用单次批量LLM查询生成多样化组件（求解器、问题实例、验证测试），并通过过滤和统计模型推断性能。

Result: 在复杂问题上，OptiHive将最优率从5%提升至92%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: OptiHive通过高效生成和过滤组件，实现了高质量、无需迭代的优化问题求解。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中生成的推理链存在冗余问题，原因是后训练过度依赖结果奖励范式，缺乏对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出PI框架，包含When、How和Which模块，动态干预推理路径，整合人类问题解决经验和认知科学原理。

Result: 实验表明，PI显著缩短推理链，减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架通过动态干预提升LLM推理的可控性和可解释性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在PMA预测中虽准确但缺乏透明度和可解释性，限制了其在临床决策中的实用性。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（PEFT）策略，结合指令调优和低秩适应（LoRA），对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行微调，使用四种2D皮层表面投影图进行训练。

Result: 模型预测误差的95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周，并能生成基于发育特征的可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高预测精度的同时增强了模型的可解释性，为围产期神经科学中的透明AI系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

TL;DR: CAMA是一个两阶段因果框架，通过构建数学因果图（MCG）并动态提取任务相关子图，显著提升LLM在复杂数学推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种任务中表现优异，但在复杂数学推理上仍有困难，主要源于深层结构依赖。CAMA旨在通过显式、可重用的数学结构解决这一问题。

Method: CAMA分为学习阶段和推理阶段。学习阶段通过因果发现算法构建MCG，并迭代优化；推理阶段动态提取任务相关子图，注入LLM以指导推理。

Result: 实验表明，CAMA显著提升LLM在数学问题上的表现，结构化指导优于非结构化方法，且非对称因果关系比对称关系更有效。

Conclusion: CAMA通过因果框架和结构化指导，有效解决了LLM在复杂数学推理中的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者转向设计更智能、自我进化的任务管理者，推动AI在科学发现中的自主性和有效性。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解释人类为何会在特定条件下将意向性和代理感赋予AI系统，尤其是基于语言表现和认知复杂性而非物理相似性。

Method: 通过多学科框架分析，结合LLM的意义整体论和LLM上下文认知场理论，阐明AI如何构建意义并模拟代理感。

Result: Noosemia被定位为与pareidolia、泛灵论等类似但独特的现象，并引入a-noosemia描述其消退过程。

Conclusion: 论文总结了Noosemia的哲学、认识论和社会意义，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Result: 在合成数据集和真实EPA数据集上，该方法生成的解释比现有方法更简单且可操作性更强。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了反事实解释的质量，还通过变量交互分析确保了决策公平性，尤其适用于高风险政策研究。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在多模态动作分布建模中表现出色，但存在表示崩溃问题，导致对细微但关键的变化处理能力不足。

Method: 提出D2PPO，通过分散损失正则化处理批次中所有隐藏表示作为负对，学习区分性表示。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，D2PPO预训练和微调分别提升22.7%和26.1%，在真实机器人实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: D2PPO有效解决了表示崩溃问题，显著提升了复杂任务的性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Result: 在Allen-Cahn等方程上实验，相对MSE降低达三个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了深度学习与物理驱动建模的空白，为多尺度和时间依赖PDE系统提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and
immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of
the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian
neocortex. A cautious assumption is made about similarities between neocortex
organisation and processes happening in our models.

Conclusion: 该框架为结构工程师提供了高效、准确的预测工具，提升了设计安全性和决策效率。

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对无缝互联网访问需求的增长，尤其是在交通和偏远地区，卫星连接的可靠性成为关键问题。移动物体（如飞机）由于频繁移动和缺乏地面覆盖，需要频繁切换卫星信号，导致连接不稳定。

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的无模型方法，用于感应电机的故障诊断，避免了传统方法中复杂的动态建模和信号预处理。


<details>

Method: 使用GNN-ASE模型直接从原始电流和振动信号中学习特征，无需预处理或手动特征提取。

Result: 模型在偏心缺陷、轴承故障和断条检测中分别达到92.5%、91.2%和93.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: GNN框架提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案，适用于实际感应电机的监测和预测性维护。

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于机器学习领域对透明度和可靠性的关注，尤其是在应用学科中可重复性问题的表现尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析建筑能源系统中机器学习应用的透明度和可重复性标准，评估了数据集、代码共享和研究作者背景等因素。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要制定可重复性指南、加强研究者培训，并通过期刊和会议政策推动透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Result: 开源预训练MVTS插补模型平均幻觉水平达59.5%，缓解方法可降低47.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的定义和方法有助于提升MVTS基础模型的采用和安全性。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了传统松弛方法的误差问题，并通过混合精度架构实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Conclusion: 自适应个性化风险检测方法对提升实时安全反馈和智能交通系统中的驾驶员支持具有重要价值。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Conclusion: 通过优化潜在边距选择模型可提升检测器对后处理图像的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单层、仅注意力架构的Transformer模型，但实际中MLP模块对知识存储贡献更大。作者发现简化模型可能无法有效获取或提取事实知识，因此提出新框架以解决这一问题。

Method: 引入了一个包含自注意力和MLP模块的单层Transformer框架，通过梯度动态分析，建立了收敛性和泛化性保证。

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer模型的知识获取和提取提供了理论支持，并解释了相关现象（如学习率调度的影响）。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,

persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD为时间序列异常检测提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Result: 实验表明，PALACE在数学、编程、医学和通用推理任务中实现了低相对误差和高预测准确性。

Conclusion: PALACE为标准化预测审计迈出重要一步，提升了透明度和用户信任。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Method: CaliMatch采用自适应标签平滑和温度缩放技术，校准分类器和OOD检测器。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CaliMatch优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CaliMatch通过校准技术有效提升了半监督学习的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

Result: 测试15个LLMs发现，静态基准表现与动态测试结果差异显著：94%的正确答案在动态鲁棒性测试中失败，隐私泄露率为86%，偏见影响临床建议的比率为81%，幻觉率超过66%。

Conclusion: DAS框架为医疗AI提供了动态、可扩展的安全保障，适用于临床实践中的LLMs应用。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合超图网络（HHN），用于建模时序多模态数据，通过分段和图结构策略解决了长时序依赖和跨模态交互的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序多模态数据（如视听数据）的分类任务中，现有方法通常独立处理模态并依赖浅层融合策略，忽略了时序依赖和复杂结构关系。

Method: HHN采用分段优先、图结构后续的策略，将序列分割为时间戳节点，通过超边捕捉模态内结构，并利用超图卷积提取高阶依赖，同时通过时间对齐和图注意力建立模态间链接。

Result: HHN在四个多模态数据集上取得了SOTA结果。

Conclusion: HHN通过分段和图结构策略有效建模了时序多模态数据，提升了分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应版本的LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），用于量化特征重要性中的协同效应，并通过三个分数（唯一、冗余和协同）描述每个特征。该方法在空气质量与阿尔茨海默病死亡率的关系中展示了协同效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征重要性方法仅通过单一分数衡量特征相关性，无法捕捉高阶效应。本文旨在通过Hi-Fi方法揭示特征之间的协同和冗余关系，提升可解释人工智能（XAI）的能力。

Method: 提出自适应LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），为每个特征分配三个分数（唯一、冗余、协同），并与Shapley效应进行比较。应用于空气质量与阿尔茨海默病死亡率的关系分析。

Result: 发现O3和NO2与死亡率之间存在协同效应，尤其是在Bergamo和Brescia地区；城市绿地密度也与污染物协同影响死亡率预测。

Conclusion: Hi-Fi方法为XAI提供了新视角，能够分析复杂系统中的高阶关系，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合海洋知识图谱和大语言模型（OKG-LLM）的新框架，用于提升海表温度（SST）预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法忽视了丰富的海洋领域知识，限制了预测精度的进一步提升。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），开发图嵌入网络学习其语义和结构知识，并与数值SST数据及预训练LLM对齐融合。

Result: 实验表明OKG-LLM在真实数据集上优于现有方法，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM为SST预测提供了新思路，具有推动领域发展的潜力。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

Motivation: 在机器学习中，特征选择是提高模型效率和准确性的关键步骤，但现有方法在特征减少和计算效率上仍有改进空间。

Method: FeatureCuts结合过滤排序和自适应特征截断点选择，优化特征子集。

Result: 在14个公开数据集和1个行业数据集上，FeatureCuts平均减少15%的特征和99.6%的计算时间，同时保持模型性能。与PSO结合时，特征减少25%，计算时间减少66%。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts是一种高效、可扩展的特征选择方法，适用于企业级大规模数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLMs在通用嵌入任务中的应用提供了高效路径，显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Result: 实验表明U^2QT在行为预测和推荐任务中优于基线方法，同时在存储和计算效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: U^2QT的统一令牌化框架支持与语言模型的无缝集成，适用于工业级应用。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia数据集上分别达到91%和84%的准确率，引入新类别后性能稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架通过基于提示的语义推理，在有限监督下实现了细粒度分类的高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Result: 增强的PGNNIV框架成功识别了本构状态方程，提高了预测精度、噪声鲁棒性，并减少了计算需求。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可针对不同场景定制，有效克服了扩展性挑战，适用于多种建模目标。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识更新和结构化的挑战，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

Motivation: 探讨多模态融合是否总能提升性能，揭示并非所有模态融合都有益，需关注互补性。

Method: 设计了五种深度学习模型（三种单模态、两种多模态），通过ECG分类实验验证模态融合效果。

Conclusion: 多模态设计的核心在于特征域的互补性而非数量，提出了量化互补性的理论框架。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Conclusion: VAULT通过自动化高质量的对抗数据生成，显著提升了NLI模型的鲁棒性，且无需人工干预。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to

Motivation: 组织病理学数据不足以全面表征分子特征和临床结果，多组学数据（如转录组、甲基化组、基因组）提供了重要信息。

Method: MORPHEUS使用掩码建模目标，随机选择组学部分进行训练，学习跨模态关系，支持单一或组合输入。

Result: 在多种任务和模态组合中，MORPHEUS表现优于现有方法，支持从H&E图像生成组学数据。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是肿瘤学中多模态基础模型的有前景框架。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

*Agrim Bari,Parikshit Hegde,Gustavo de Veciana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大语言模型（LLM）推理系统的调度策略，通过优化资源分配和请求调度，显著提升了吞吐量和响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM工具的广泛应用，其独特的预填充和解码两阶段计算结构需要新的路由和调度策略以提高效率。

Method: 提出了理论框架，设计了两大原则（最优分块和动态资源分配），并开发了RAD调度器和SLAI调度器。

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上测试，SLAI将中位TTFT降低53%，最大服务容量提升26%，同时满足尾部TBT延迟约束。

Conclusion: SLAI调度器通过动态优先级和资源分配，显著优化了LLM推理系统的性能。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: v-PuNNs是一种新型神经网络架构，利用p-adic数表示层次结构数据，通过TURL原则和VAPO优化方法，在多个基准测试中取得优异性能，并扩展到量子系统和生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在欧几里得空间中处理层次结构数据效果不佳，需要一种更适合严格层次结构（如分类、词义、文件系统）的表示方法。

Method: 提出v-PuNNs架构，神经元为p-adic球的特征函数，采用TURL原则使权重为p-adic数，并开发VAPO优化方法（包括HiPaN-DS和Adam-VAPO）。

Result: 在WordNet、GO分子功能和NCBI哺乳动物分类基准测试中取得最佳性能，学习到的度量具有完美超度量性质。

Conclusion: v-PuNNs将数论与深度学习结合，为层次数据提供精确、可解释且高效的模型，并扩展到量子系统和生成任务。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Result: 实验表明，MA-PROPS能更高效地减少联合采样误差，并提高独立策略梯度算法的收敛可靠性。

Conclusion: MA-PROPS通过减少采样误差，显著提升了多智能体强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Motivation: 现有数据集多关注分子级性质预测，忽略了功能组信息的作用。功能组数据能提供分子结构与文本描述间的联系，有助于构建更可解释的LLMs。

Method: 构建FGBench数据集，包含625K分子性质推理问题，精确标注功能组信息，涵盖单功能组影响、多功能组交互和分子直接比较三类任务。

Result: 在7K精选数据上测试，当前LLMs在功能组级性质推理表现不佳，需提升化学任务推理能力。

Conclusion: FGBench的方法论为构建功能组级数据集提供了框架，有助于LLMs理解分子结构与性质的细粒度关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset
and evaluation code are available at

intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

Motivation: 动态系统学习在许多领域至关重要，但传统数学模型在缺失变量和噪声数据下表现不佳，需要新的机器学习方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用流匹配变体进行概率预测，生成式机器学习扰动高维动态系统状态，并建立数学基础。

Result: 方法在多个挑战性动态系统（包括高维WeatherBench数据集）中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理复杂动态系统中的不确定性，为概率预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Result: 离线分析显示BUS显著优于传统方法，实际部署后在线指标（如音乐排名和邮件通知）有显著提升。

Conclusion: BUS是首个在大规模工业场景中结合用户属性和行为的列表式学习排序框架，具有语义可解释性。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Conclusion: Transformer-based PRNGs具有潜力，能够生成高质量的伪随机数，并通过理论验证和实验支持。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Conclusion: DisTaC为模型合并提供了一种鲁棒的预处理方法，显著提升了合并效果。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习的核心挑战在于平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能获取，现有方法通常孤立处理这两者，忽视了它们的内在关联。

Method: T2S通过参数标记化将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转化为输入与可学习标记之间的跨注意力机制，增强模型扩展性，并引入语言引导的技能扩展以实现跨任务知识高效迁移。

Result: 实验表明，T2S在防止灾难性遗忘（NBT平均1.0%）、新技能扩展（仅需8.0%可训练标记）和跨任务知识迁移（FWT平均77.7%）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了一个有效的解决方案，平衡了遗忘与新技能获取的需求。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习模型在动态市场条件下难以平衡风险与回报，MARS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MARS采用异构智能体集合，每个智能体具有独特的风险偏好，并通过安全评估网络和风险容忍阈值进行控制。高层Meta-Adaptive Controller动态调整智能体权重以适应市场变化。

Result: 实验表明，MARS在风险调整指标上表现优异，显著降低了最大回撤和波动率，同时保持竞争力回报。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性而非显式市场特征工程，实现了风险与回报的优越平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

TL;DR: 论文提出RSPO方法，直接优化风险寻求指标Pass@k和Max@k，解决了传统风险中性目标与评估指标不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的后训练优化采用风险中性目标，而评估却依赖风险寻求指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RSPO方法，通过利用闭式概率解决低奖励响应被无意强化的问题，并设计高效无偏梯度估计器。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明RSPO能有效优化Pass@k和Max@k。

Conclusion: RSPO成功解决了风险偏好不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Motivation: 传统空间插值方法在传感器覆盖有限且不规则时效果不佳，需要更可靠的方法来支持决策。

Method: 利用图神经网络（GNN）的插值参考数据，结合主邻域聚合（PNA）和地理位置编码（GPE），学习时空依赖性，并提出静态可视化技术。

Result: 在真实数据集和用户研究中，模型在数据插值和不确定性可视化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了时空数据插值的可靠性，并通过可视化设计有效传达了不确定性信息。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

*Shiko Kudo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种周期性线性单元（PLU），一种基于正弦波的可学习激活函数，具有周期性非单调性，显著提升了神经网络的表达能力和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络主要依赖简单的单调递增激活函数（如ReLU），需要大规模参数化模型才能逼近复杂函数。PLU旨在通过周期性非单调性提升表达能力和效率。

Method: PLU通过正弦波设计和排斥性重新参数化（Repulsive Reparameterization）实现高表达能力和数值稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，仅含两个PLU神经元的最小MLP即可解决螺旋分类任务，而传统激活函数无法实现。

Conclusion: PLU标志着从分段泰勒式逼近到傅里叶式函数合成的范式转变，显著提升了参数效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

Conclusion: GOODIE通过混合方法和注意力机制有效解决了特征缺失问题，提升了节点分类性能。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦无监督学习中难以实现全局均匀性，主要由于非独立同分布数据和去中心化特性。

Method: SSD通过鼓励客户端表示向不同方向扩展，减少聚合干扰，并引入投影蒸馏模块优化损失与表示质量之间的差异。

Result: 在跨设备和跨中心的联邦设置中，SSD显著提升了表示质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD证明了全局均匀性在FUL中的重要性，并提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，提出无需显式探索激励的新方法。

Method: 通过三个条件（环境结构重复性、代理记忆能力、长时程信用分配）验证贪婪目标下代理的自发探索行为。

Result: 实验表明，在结构和记忆存在时，贪婪目标代理能自发探索；移除任一条件会抑制探索行为。

Conclusion: 探索行为可以在统一奖励最大化过程中自然产生，无需正交目标设计。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Result: 在2D和3D流场重建中，PINN模型表现优异，尤其在湍流情况下仍能准确学习物理规律。

Conclusion: PINNs在稀疏数据下具有强大的流场重建能力，为实际工程应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交叉验证方法（如KFCV）计算量大且可能导致泛化评估不足，而SRS在数据不平衡时可能产生非代表性样本。FSV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FSV结合了SRS和KFCV，引入加权因子以增强性能和泛化能力。实验使用了三个数据集（10,000、50,000和100,000样本），评估了ME、VE、MSE等指标。

Result: FSV在ME、VE、MSE等指标上均优于SRS和KFCV，表现出更高的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: FSV在资源受限环境和大型数据集中提供了更优的数据分区解决方案，适用于高效机器学习实现。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Motivation: 深度强化学习中，训练策略在变化的状态和动作分布下容易导致次优性能或崩溃，即使改进探索算法或奖励目标，优化困难仍可能阻碍进步。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，通过实验评估不同环境和RL算法的优化限制。

Result: 实验表明，生成的最佳经验与策略学习性能之间存在2-3倍的差距，表明深度RL方法仅利用了一半的好经验。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习算法在利用生成经验方面存在显著不足，优化限制是主要瓶颈。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates

Conclusion: 为LoRA-based FL提供了理论框架，指导聚合策略的选择以实现高效收敛。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

*Rémi Bardenet,Mylène Maïda,Martin Rouault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用Gibbs测度作为随机数值积分算法的方法，通过调节相互作用核和约束势能，使系统的平衡测度与目标分布π一致。随机近似势能的方法保留了快速大偏差原理，从而优于独立或马尔可夫积分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用Gibbs测度（如库仑气体）模拟相互作用粒子系统，通过粒子间的排斥性减少积分误差。

Method: 调节Gibbs测度的相互作用核和约束势能，使其平衡测度与目标分布π一致，并使用随机近似势能的方法。

Result: 随机近似势能保留了快速大偏差原理，使积分算法优于独立或马尔可夫积分。对于非奇异相互作用核，随机近似可以是计算廉价的蒙特卡洛预处理；对于库仑相互作用核，近似需基于另一个Gibbs测度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过随机近似势能，有效解决了调节问题，并在理论上证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

TL;DR: 研究了特征相关性对Dense Associative Memory（DAM）容量的影响，发现特征相关性略微降低容量，但对指数增长关系无根本影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际机器学习场景中数据特征相关，但现有容量分析未考虑此因素，需填补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 通过构造不同特征相关性和模式分离的数据集，使用汉明距离和二分搜索算法计算存储容量。

Result: 内存容量随输入空间分离度指数增长，特征相关性略微降低容量，高次能量函数下影响更显著。

Conclusion: DAM在高阶特征交互中表现受限，研究为理论和实践架桥，可能启发更多数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Conclusion: CPformer通过结合概念透明性和物理约束，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Result: LSTM模型表现最优，包含流动性指标后预测准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: 流动性指标对加密货币价格预测至关重要，建议将其纳入模型以提高准确性，为交易者和开发者提供更智能的策略。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Result: 实验表明，UniExtreme在极端和一般天气预测中均优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: UniExtreme展示了在多样化极端天气场景中的卓越适应性和预测能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Motivation: 不平衡回归问题中，目标分布偏斜导致模型难以处理稀疏样本，现有方法依赖固定阈值，无法准确识别稀疏区域。

Result: 在32个基准数据集上表现优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预设阈值，能更准确地识别和增强稀疏样本，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Result: 在相同时间限制下，CASP系统能解决26%至86%更多的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了延迟，使AI驱动的CASP系统更适用于高通量合成筛选，并提升了用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 历史标记有效解决了Transformer在序列分类任务中的局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet是一种高效、可扩展的分类方法，未来将探索更多混沌映射以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Result: 平衡探索与开发的冷却形状表现最佳；调整AdamW超参数和β2值显著提升性能；损失景观可视化支持河流谷损失观点。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段配置对Transformer训练至关重要，需与传统超参数调优结合。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 现有时间序列编辑方法依赖预定义的属性向量，缺乏灵活性和可定制性。

Method: 引入基于指令的时间序列编辑框架InstructTime，通过多模态表示空间和分辨率编码器实现局部和全局编辑。

Result: 实验表明InstructTime在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，支持可控编辑强度并泛化到未见指令。

Conclusion: InstructTime是一种高质量、灵活且可扩展的时间序列编辑方法。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

TL;DR: FlashSVD是一种针对SVD压缩大型语言模型的端到端框架，通过避免激活缓冲区的高内存开销，显著降低峰值推理内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法虽能减少模型参数，但忽略了推理时激活内存的开销，限制了实际部署的可行性。

Method: FlashSVD通过融合低秩投影核到自注意力和前馈网络管道中，动态加载和计算截断因子，避免全尺寸激活缓冲区的生成。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD将峰值激活内存减少70.2%，中间临时内存减少75%，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩LLM在内存受限环境中的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列通常具有周期性结构，但现有深度预测模型因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知先验而难以捕捉这些模式。

Method: 通过FFT引导的坐标下降提取主导低频分量，初始化正弦嵌入，并采用双速学习计划保持频率结构。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长时预测中，且能准确恢复合成数据的真实频率。

Conclusion: 将频谱先验注入深度时序模型可提升长期预测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管划桨运动在全球范围内非常流行，但机器学习的应用有限，且传统教练和设备的成本较高，因此需要一种低成本、可访问的替代方案。

Method: 研究通过Apple Watch和智能手机收集运动数据，使用多种机器学习模型（如支持向量分类器、随机森林等）分析数据，并开发了一个基于网络的界面提供反馈。

Result: 在66个划桨样本中，极端随机树模型表现最佳（F分数0.9496），传感器靠近手腕时数据质量更高。

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Motivation: 室内定位在复杂环境中支持多种基于位置的服务，但非独立同分布数据和设备异构性使其实际部署面临挑战。

Method: 提出SimDeep框架，采用相似性聚合策略，基于数据相似性聚合客户端模型更新。

Result: 实验结果显示SimDeep精度达92.89%，优于传统联邦和集中式方法。

Conclusion: SimDeep在解决非独立同分布数据和设备异构性方面表现出色，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 研究刚性系统中参数梯度消失现象的根本原因及其对优化和参数识别的影响。

Method: 分析刚性数值积分方案的稳定性函数及其导数，推导参数梯度的衰减规律，并提供常见方案的显式公式。

Result: 证明所有A-稳定时间步进方法在刚性区域必然抑制参数梯度，且衰减速率最慢为$O(|z|^{-1})$。

Conclusion: 刚性系统中的梯度消失现象是普遍且不可避免的，这对训练和参数识别提出了显著挑战。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

TL;DR: 原型神经网络通过输入与训练数据中的代表性信号模式比较，提供可解释的预测。研究发现，这些原型在外部临床数据库中与医院出院诊断（phecode）显著相关，且比分类器预测或NLP提取的概念更具特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究原型神经网络的原型是否能够捕捉与广泛临床表型一致的基础结构。

Method: 使用基于原型的深度学习模型在PTB-XL数据集上训练多标签ECG分类，然后在MIMIC-IV临床数据库上进行推断，评估原型与phecode的关联。

Result: 原型显示出与临床结果的显著关联，预测性能强（AUC 0.89-0.91），并能区分诊断类别内的临床变异。

Conclusion: 原型模型支持从生理时间序列数据中进行可解释的数字表型分析，提供可转移的中间表型。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESPP问题在存在负权环时是NP难问题，传统方法难以高效求解。本文旨在通过无监督学习提供一种新的解决方案。

Method: 使用无监督图神经网络联合学习节点值估计和边选择概率，通过替代损失函数减少负权环并嵌入算法对齐。推理时通过解码算法将边概率转化为路径。

Result: 在100节点以下的图上，该方法优于无监督基线和经典启发式算法，并在未见过的合成图上表现出良好的跨规模和跨拓扑泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为ESPP问题提供了一种高效的概率解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Motivation: 现有基于多层感知机 (MLP) 的方法忽视了时间序列建模中的层次局部性和序列归纳偏差，性能提升有限。

Method: 引入KANMixer架构，利用KAN的自适应基函数能力，设计多尺度混合主干网络。

Result: 在7个基准数据集的28个实验中，KANMixer在16个实验中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: KAN的自适应灵活性显著改变了网络结构先验对预测性能的影响，为LTSF中有效利用KAN提供了实证指导。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

Result: 实验表明，DC-PFL显著减少了训练时间并提高了模型准确性。

Conclusion: DC-PFL是一种有效的个性化联邦学习方法，适用于数据异构性高的场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

management in edge computing networks, semantic communications and other
notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations
of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research
directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Conclusion: 本文为去噪分数匹配提供了理论支持，并证明启发式加权在实际训练中的优势。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Result: 实验表明，结合人类反馈显著提升了模型在复杂环境中的决策能力。

Conclusion: ARL框架结合机器效率和人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用提供了一种可扩展的性能提升方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Result: TCDiff在数据保真度上平均优于现有方法10%，同时保持隐私性。

Conclusion: TCDiff在真实医疗场景中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受攻击且易记忆训练数据，引发隐私泄露问题，需开发无需保留数据的遗忘方法。

Method: 采用梯度上升和动态分配遗忘强度的策略，仅基于遗忘集进行遗忘。

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中表现优于现有无需保留数据的遗忘方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单有效的机器学习遗忘方法，显著提升遗忘效果并保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

*Yuanteng Chen,Yuantian Shao,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAC-MoE通过量化和剪枝技术解决MoE-LLMs的内存消耗和推理速度问题，提出QESC和PESF模块，显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE在扩展LLMs时面临GPU内存消耗大和低激活参数无法等效加速推理的挑战。

Method: 提出EAC-MoE框架，包含QESC模块（校准路由器以减少量化偏差）和PESF模块（剪枝低频使用专家以提升速度）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少内存使用并提升推理速度，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: EAC-MoE有效解决了MoE-LLMs的关键挑战，为高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出USRFNet，一种深度学习网络，用于解决微服务架构中性能监控和资源管理的挑战，通过分离和建模流量侧和资源侧特征，显著提升P95尾延迟预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性带来了性能监控和资源管理的挑战，传统方法依赖的请求延迟指标对瞬时噪声敏感，无法全面反映复杂并发工作负载的行为。

Method: USRFNet采用图神经网络（GNN）捕捉服务交互和请求传播模式，同时使用gMLP模块独立建模集群资源动态，最后融合为统一系统嵌入以预测P95延迟。

Result: 在真实微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试条件下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和融合流量与资源特征，提供了一种稳定且高精度的微服务性能预测方法。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式机器学习模型在隐私敏感领域的广泛应用，确保安全推理成为关键挑战。现有方法在通信和计算开销上存在瓶颈，尤其是浮点运算的安全评估。

Method: 采用细粒度分层量化方案，支持1位权重全连接层；设计多输入查找表协议评估softmax；使用双秘密共享方案和查找表进行精度转换，消除截断开销。

Result: 在BERT-base模型上实验表明，相比现有方法，速度提升最高达8倍、9倍和22倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了安全推理的开销，同时保持了隐私保护能力，为隐私敏感领域的模型部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

Motivation: 当前SNN主要依赖速率编码，忽略了脉冲时序信息中的丰富计算线索，导致时空动态性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出SPARTA框架，通过竞争门控机制基于脉冲时序信息（如发放模式、脉冲间隔）选择最显著token，实现65.4%的稀疏性。

Conclusion: 利用脉冲时序动态性可同时提升计算效率和模型精度。

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型异构联邦学习框架，通过交换特征分布而非模型参数，提升客户端的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性导致泛化性能低的问题，特别是在模型架构异构的场景下。

Method: 客户端与服务器交换特征分布（均值和协方差），训练变分转置卷积网络生成合成数据，用于微调本地模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在泛化准确率上优于现有异构框架，且通信成本和内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了模型异构联邦学习的性能，同时降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习存在通信开销、系统异构性和滞后效应问题，AFL通过独立更新客户端解决了这些问题，但需进一步适应现代深度学习的非凸性和异构性。

Method: 提出了一种基于新鲜度的聚合方法和动态学习率调度，分析了客户端选择策略对收敛的影响，并在PyTorch中实现。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在异步、异构和非凸场景下的性能提升和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AFL中的滞后和异构性问题，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了广义核化赌博机（GKB）中的遗憾最小化问题，提出了一种乐观算法GKB-UCB，并推导了新的自归一化不等式，最终得到了与现有最优结果匹配的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核化赌博机（KB）和广义线性赌博机（GLB）的遗憾分析无法直接扩展到广义核化赌博机（GKB）中，因此需要新的理论和算法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，并基于Freedman不等式和拼接技术，设计了一种新的自归一化Bernstein-like不等式。

Result: 得到了遗憾界为$\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$，与KB和GLB的最优结果一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为核化赌博机和广义线性赌博机提供了一个统一的框架，并展示了算法的有效性。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在将序列架构（如Transformers和LLMs）应用于结构化表格数据时，无法统一编码数值和分类特征或保留表格结构的问题。

Method: 结合预定义固定标记表示结构元素和低基数分类特征，使用BPE子词编码处理高基数和连续值。

Result: 在NetFlow数据集（CIDDS-001）上高效处理3100万网络流，压缩比6.18:1，生成10亿标记的语料库。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构化数据训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的途径。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

TL;DR: PHAR是一个将时间序列分类模型的特征归因转化为结构化、人类可读规则的后处理框架，提升模型透明度和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类模型的解释性差，高维输入空间和原始时间序列难以理解。

Method: PHAR将后处理解释器（如LIME、SHAP）的数值特征归因转化为规则，通过规则融合步骤优化覆盖、置信度和简洁性。

Result: PHAR在UCI数据集上表现优异，提升了解释性、决策透明度和实际应用性。

Conclusion: PHAR为时间序列分类提供了高效、可扩展的解释框架，解决了规则冲突和重叠问题。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在随机场景中继承了确定性方法的全局指数收敛性，并提供了策略质量的评估理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR在生成质量和效率上均优于现有方法，为条件生成模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过去除冗余参数和语义噪声，OccamVTS在轻量级网络中保留了关键时间模式，显著提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 解决交互式大语言模型实时推理的高能耗问题，传统静态或规则化策略难以兼顾性能与节能。

Method: 提出AGFT框架，利用在线强化学习动态调整GPU频率，结合实时监控和智能动作空间剪枝。

Result: 实验显示AGFT节省44.3% GPU能耗，性能延迟增加低于10%，综合能效优化达40.3%。

Conclusion: AGFT显著提升LLM推理集群的能效与经济性，不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大规模语言模型（LLMs）的持续预训练方法，比较了经验回放和梯度对齐两种技术，发现它们能有效减少分布偏移带来的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据出现时需要从头开始，效率低下。持续预训练是一种更高效的替代方法，但面临分布偏移导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 研究了经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，并在Llama架构上进行了大规模多语言实验（每种语言1000亿标记）。

Result: 两种方法均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，梯度对齐在LLM预训练中首次被证明有效。小比例回放旧样本比增加模型规模更高效。

Conclusion: 持续预训练中，小比例回放旧样本比增加模型规模更有效，但模型规模扩展比高比例回放更高效。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限环境中的高能耗、非独立同分布数据和不可靠通信问题。

Result: 在典型计算机视觉任务中表现出更快的收敛速度和更高的能源效率。

Conclusion: FedDPQ首次从数据、计算和通信角度联合优化联邦学习性能，适用于不可靠无线网络。

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 探索神经网络表示空间的组织方式，特别是不同信息是否编码在分离的子空间中，以及能否无监督地发现这些子空间。

Method: 提出邻居距离最小化（NDM）方法，无监督学习非基对齐的子空间。

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释性强，定量实验验证了子空间与GPT-2中已知电路的关联，并证明方法可扩展到20亿参数模型。

Conclusion: NDM为理解模型内部表示和构建电路提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中表现优异，但在复杂或多模态条件下，生成的轨迹与协变量之间常存在语义不对齐问题。

Method: 引入评分网络评估扩散状态与未来协变量的语义对齐，通过逐步重要性重加权调整采样路径，不改变原始训练过程。

Result: 在真实世界预测任务中，该方法在预测准确性和协变量对齐方面均取得显著提升，尤其在复杂条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: SemGuide是一种即插即用的推理时方法，适用于任何条件扩散框架，有效解决了语义不对齐问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Method: 提出Mol-SFT（通过GPT-4o生成的合成CoT样本初始化模型）和Mol-RL（通过强化学习增强推理能力）。

Result: 显著提升模型的分子理解和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MolReasoner实现了从记忆到化学推理的转变，提升了模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Motivation: 传统优化方法（如ADAM）依赖手动定义的梯度估计，限制了灵活性和效率。本文旨在通过可训练的优化策略提升性能。

Method: 提出伪线性TO方法，作为全梯度的线性近似，匹配SGD的收敛速度并减少方差。还引入两种简化变体以提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，TO方法在强凸和非凸场景下均比基准算法（如ADAM）收敛更快，并在LLM微调中表现优异。

Conclusion: 可训练的优化框架在性能和效率上优于传统方法，为优化领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

Result: 在TSP和CVRP基准测试中表现优异，能泛化到1000节点实例且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: VAGPO在学习和扩展性方面表现出色，为路由问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

Conclusion: CRINN的成功不仅验证了强化学习在ANNS优化中的有效性，还展示了LLM结合强化学习在自动化复杂算法优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Motivation: 异步和去中心化使得联邦学习中的模型更新信息模糊，客户端退出后难以恢复，现有方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出自适应策略，基于客户端重构，结合本地正则化，并在三种数据异构场景下评估。

Result: 实验表明，自适应策略能有效维持联邦学习的鲁棒性，即使无法精确重构缺失客户端数据。

Conclusion: 论文提出的策略在异步DFL中表现良好，但仍存在局限性，未来需进一步研究客户端退出问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Conclusion: 通过控制理论和多步优化，该方法能够实现稳健且可泛化的性能。

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency

LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Result: 实验显示PCPO具有显著稳定性，为约束下的策略优化提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Conclusion: PCPO框架在理论和实验上均表现出色，对未来的研究和实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Result: 在多个数学基准测试和跨领域测试中，CAPO表现优于监督学习和强化学习方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度信用分配和投票机制，显著提升了强化学习的效率和效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

### [310] [How Does Controllability Emerge In Language Models During Pretraining?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01892)
*Jianshu She,Xinyue Li,Eric Xing,Zhengzhong Liu,Qirong Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型内部表示修改对生成内容的控制效果，发现线性可操纵性在训练中期出现，并提出统一框架Intervention Detector（ID）分析其动态演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部表示修改对生成内容控制的有效条件，填补现有研究中依赖启发式和试错的空白。

Method: 提出Intervention Detector（ID）框架，通过隐藏状态和表示分析揭示线性可操纵性在训练中的演变，并引入ID相关指标（如热图、熵趋势和余弦相似度）。

Result: 发现概念在隐藏空间中线性可分性与线性可操纵性密切相关，且不同概念的可操纵性在训练的不同阶段出现。

Conclusion: ID框架能有效揭示线性可操纵性的动态演变，适用于不同模型家族，为模型控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

*Adam Darmanin,Vince Vella*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和强化学习（RL）的混合系统，用于生成交易策略，并通过专家评估和财务指标验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在交易决策中存在短视行为和不透明性问题，而LLM展现出战略推理和多模态信号处理能力，因此探索两者结合以优化交易策略。

Method: 设计混合系统，LLM生成高层交易策略指导RL代理，通过专家评估策略合理性，并比较Sharpe Ratio和Maximum Drawdown等财务指标。

Result: 结果显示，LLM引导的代理在收益和风险指标上优于标准RL方法。

Conclusion: LLM与RL的结合能有效提升交易策略的长期表现和可解释性。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的迭代解释框架，通过对齐训练数据分布与解释阶段的加权图分布，提升GNN解释的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在加权图上优化软边掩码，但GNN训练时使用未加权图，导致分布偏移和解释质量下降。

Method: 交替进行解释子图识别和模型适应，逐步缩小子图范围，结合重要性感知边权重重新训练GNN。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和不同GNN架构上验证，解释质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能灵活集成不同架构，有效改善GNN解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

### [313] [Inferring Reward Machines and Transition Machines from Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01947)
*Yuly Wu,Jiamou Liu,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自动机表示方法（Transition Machines, TMs）和统一的推断算法（DBMM），解决了部分可观测环境中非马尔可夫性处理的局限性，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）在现实应用中广泛存在，但现有方法在处理非马尔可夫性时存在局限性（如仅关注奖励或计算成本高）。

Method: 引入Transition Machines（TMs）与Reward Machines（RMs）互补，提出Dual Behavior Mealy Machine（DBMM）统一表示，并设计高效推断算法DB-RPNI。

Result: 实验显示，新方法比现有基线快三个数量级，且能推断出最小正确自动机。

Conclusion: DBMM和DB-RPNI为部分可观测环境中的非马尔可夫性问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Result: 元学习在组合复杂性上表现更优，通过增加适应步数可提升复杂概念的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了组合与特征复杂性学习的差异，为理解二阶方法和梯度适应在少样本学习中的作用提供了路径。

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Method: 分析多种架构，识别三种参考框架类型，并研究其与注意力汇聚现象的相关性。

Result: 发现参考框架在训练早期作为高维空间中稳定坐标系统的最优解出现，并受位置编码实现方式影响。

Conclusion: 研究转变了对Transformer注意力机制的理解，为架构设计和注意力汇聚现象的关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

TL;DR: OptiGridML是一种用于电力网络离散拓扑优化的机器学习框架，通过两阶段神经架构替代传统MIP求解，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合整数规划（MIP）方法在大型网络中计算复杂度高，难以实时求解。

Method: 采用线图神经网络（LGNN）近似直流潮流，异构GNN（HeteroGNN）预测断路器状态，并通过物理一致性损失连接两者。

Result: 在1000个断路器的合成网络中，功率输出提升18%，推理时间从小时级降至毫秒级。

Conclusion: 结构化、流感知的GNN有望加速物理网络系统的组合优化。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT策略未能利用MoE的动态路由机制，因此探索是否应在适应模块中引入路由机制以匹配MoE的多专家架构。

Method: 分析了PEFT应用于MoE语言模型时的核心组件动态，并研究了不同路由策略对适应效果的影响。

Result: 在OLMoE-1B-7B和Mixtral-8x7B上的实验验证了路由方法的性能和效率，并确定了不同场景下的最优配置。

Conclusion: 研究为PEFT和MoE应用提供了实用见解，促进了更好的性能优化。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

*Alexander Norcliffe,Changhee Lee,Fergus Imrie,Mihaela van der Schaar,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于潜在变量模型的主动特征获取方法，解决了现有方法训练困难或短视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如强化学习训练困难，或基于条件互信息的贪婪方法过于短视，需要改进。

Method: 引入潜在变量模型，通过随机潜在空间推理未观测特征。

Result: 在多种合成和真实数据集上表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了主动特征获取中的训练和短视问题。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

*Yixin Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kron-LoRA是一种参数高效且表达能力强的适配器，通过Kronecker乘积和低秩分解减少参数，同时保持性能，适用于多任务大语言模型调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型在多任务调优中参数效率与表达能力的需求。

Method: 使用Kronecker乘积分解线性更新，并通过低秩LoRA分解进一步压缩参数。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上，Kron-LoRA以更少参数匹配或超越标准LoRA性能，并支持量化。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA为多任务大语言模型调优提供了高效、可持续且支持持续学习的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中，通过中间步骤奖励模型（PRMs）提前拒绝次优候选方案，以提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在提升推理质量时引入了大量计算开销，尤其是在并行生成大量解决方案时。研究旨在验证PRMs是否能通过中间信号提前拒绝次优候选，从而减少计算负担。

Method: 提出PRMs也是部分奖励模型的假设，证明中间步骤的评分能预测最终输出质量，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，该方法实现了1.4倍至9倍的推理FLOPs减少，且不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 早期拒绝机制是提升LLM推理计算效率的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHRs）包含多模态数据，准确预测临床结果对早期干预和资源分配至关重要。现有方法未能充分利用这些数据。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1）通过微调的大型语言模型（LLM）从临床笔记中提取关键信息，并结合图检索外部知识；2）结合非结构化表示和结构化数据生成最终预测。

Result: 在30天再入院和院内死亡率预测中，AUC分别达到0.84和0.92，优于现有基线方法和临床实践。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM和图检索方法，显著提升了临床预测性能，为医疗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: KAFNet是一种基于CPA的紧凑架构，用于IMTS预测，通过预卷积、时间核聚合和频率线性注意力模块，显著提升了性能并减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS建模中，传统的CPA方法因零填充导致计算开销大，而现有图模型难以捕捉全局相关性，因此需要一种既能保留CPA优势又能高效处理的方法。

Method: KAFNet结合预卷积模块、时间核聚合模块和频率线性注意力块，分别处理序列平滑、不规则性建模和低成本相关性建模。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上，KAFNet实现了最先进的预测性能，参数减少7.2倍，训练推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet通过优化CPA处理，证明了其在IMTS预测中的高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Motivation: 现有的脉冲Transformer模型参数多、计算成本高，限制了其在资源受限环境中的部署。

Result: 实验表明，方法显著减少了模型大小和计算开销，同时保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的剪枝和补偿策略有效构建了高效且高性能的脉冲Transformer模型。

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Conclusion: GRAD有效解决了现代广告主多样化和动态需求，展示了生成模型在自动竞价系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and
10.68% increase in ROI.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶测试中，背景车辆（BVs）的驾驶行为模型对生成安全关键场景至关重要，尤其是合作对抗性驾驶行为。

Method: 使用MARL训练双模态驾驶员模型（非对抗和对抗模式），并将其连接到连续模拟交通环境中，通过演化场景生成方法生成复杂多样的安全关键场景。

Result: Dual-DM在场景保真度（>85%相似度）和复杂性（0.45）上表现优异，生成效率显著提升（0.86，+195%），且场景多样性得到验证。

Conclusion: Dual-DM通过演化场景生成方法显著提升了安全关键场景的生成性能。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

Conclusion: 提出可推广的证据标准，用于定性研究中AI判断的校准。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Result: 框架支持模型即服务（MaaS）提供商构建高效的预训练模型库，实现多源无数据监督迁移学习。

Conclusion: 该框架为无源数据迁移学习提供了可行解决方案，扩展了迁移学习的应用场景。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

Result: 在真实数据集上，Epi$^2$-Net表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net为未来流行病防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 该研究为高效的时空建模建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 微调可能导致对齐漂移，削弱模型的安全性和行为约束，因此需要一种方法来保持对齐。

Method: AGL 结合了主任务损失、Fisher 信息矩阵正则化、任务特定正则化和碰撞感知正则化（包括黎曼重叠和测地分离）。

Result: AGL 在安全关键基准测试中将对齐漂移减少高达 50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL 是一种结构化的 LoRA 改进方法，能有效保持对齐，同时开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 该算法为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Method: 提出Amber Pruner和Outstanding-sparse框架，结合N:M激活稀疏与W8A8量化。

Result: 在多种模型和稀疏比下，加速55%以上线性计算且无需重训练，下游任务性能稳定。

Conclusion: 为激活稀疏开辟新方向，指导下一代AI系统的算法与架构设计。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究分析了气候变化对新西兰猕猴桃产量的影响，使用无监督异常检测方法揭示极端天气事件与产量之间的关系，并指出当前方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧了极端天气事件的频率和严重性，对农业产生重大挑战，研究旨在量化其对猕猴桃产量的具体影响。

Method: 采用Isolation Forest方法分析历史气候数据和极端事件，结合猕猴桃产量数据。

Result: 发现不同类型极端事件对产量的影响差异显著，当前方法在识别某些事件（如霜冻）时存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需整合农场管理策略和气候适应措施，未来将采用集成方法提高检测准确性。

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedLAD的新防御方法，通过线性代数优化检测联邦学习中的Sybil攻击，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习构成重大威胁，恶意节点可能主导系统，因此需要开发有效的防御措施。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性问题，通过提取独立的线性组合来过滤恶意元素。

Result: FedLAD在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时保持低攻击成功率，在0.2至0.5时保持高模型精度。

Conclusion: FedLAD能有效提升联邦学习系统在数据投毒攻击下的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前96%以上的人类蛋白质未被药物开发，现有虚拟筛选方法缺乏原子级精度和结合适应性预测能力。

Method: AuroBind结合直接偏好优化、自蒸馏和师生加速策略，预测配体结合结构和结合适应性。

Result: AuroBind在结构和功能基准测试中优于现有模型，筛选速度提升10万倍，实验命中率达7-69%。

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与药物发现之间的空白。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 大规模模型（LSMs）在语义通信（SC）系统中具有潜力，但其高计算复杂性和资源需求限制了直接部署。

Method: 1. 提出KDL-DARTS算法，结合知识蒸馏和复杂度惩罚，搜索轻量级语义编码器架构；2. 开发两阶段RKD算法，从LSM（教师）向紧凑编码器（学生）转移语义能力并增强鲁棒性；3. 引入CAT块作为信道编解码器，提升信道噪声下的性能。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，RKD-SC显著减少了模型参数，同时保持了教师模型的高性能，并表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为高效且鲁棒的语义通信提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹预测对制定前瞻性策略至关重要，但现有方法难以同时捕捉全局和局部时间信息，且用户行为的多尺度特性增加了预测难度。

Method: 结合MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN通过多尺度卷积核提取局部时间信息，并使用CA融合两者。

Result: 在12步预测中，MSE和MAE分别降低了5.04%和4.35%，推理时间与ModernTCN相当。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了轨迹预测中的多尺度时间信息融合问题，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Motivation: 个人贷款平台需优化信用额度等连续多维处理，但现有方法难以处理此类问题，且需满足金融领域单调性要求。

Method: 提出Multi-Treatment-DML框架，利用双机器学习（DML）去偏观测数据，处理连续多维处理，并强制单调约束。

Result: 在公共基准和真实工业数据集上验证有效性，在线A/B测试证实其在实际贷款操作中的优越性。

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML解决了连续多维处理的因果估计问题，满足金融领域需求，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型重训练，高效且可扩展，为提升语言模型的事实可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Method: 设计了一个网络化LLM系统，包括用户、中央任务处理器和专业LLM集群，通过优化路由和聚合策略平衡准确性和响应时间。

Result: 模拟实验表明，聚合响应比单个LLM具有更高的准确性，尤其是在参与模型性能相近时。

Conclusion: 聚合小型专业LLM是一种有效提升响应质量的方法，尤其适用于模型性能相似的情况。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务中，MPFT表现出优于现有方法的超体积性能，同时减少交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架为多目标强化学习提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

Motivation: 解决分割学习（SL）中因恶意客户端导致的模型准确性下降问题。

Method: 将客户端分为N+1个集群，独立训练并选择验证损失最低的集群，丢弃恶意更新。Pigeon-SL+通过重复训练选定的集群提高效率。

Result: 在标签翻转、激活和梯度操纵三种攻击模型下，显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL和Pigeon-SL+在智能无线网络中展现出更高的抗攻击能力和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统和学习方法的局限性，适用于多种图类型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 由于商业敏感性和竞争考虑，飞行操作数据的获取受限，阻碍了预测模型的发展。本文研究合成数据是否能有效替代真实数据用于训练模型。

Method: 使用Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR)方法，评估四种合成数据生成器在三个预测任务中的表现，并通过保真度评估验证数据质量。

Result: 高级神经网络架构（如基于Transformer的生成器）能保留94-97%的真实数据预测性能，同时保持特征重要性模式。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可在保护商业机密的同时支持航空分析，但需对预测准确性保持现实预期。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Method: 提出DE-SNE算法（DNN-free样本选择）和近内存计算技术，构建NMS系统。

Result: NMS在模型精度上优于现有方法（DQ、DQAS、NeSSA）。

Conclusion: NMS是首个能有效解决泛化问题和DDR能耗问题的DNN-free近内存采样技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究通过动力学和压缩视角为分类问题提供了新的理论基础，而非追求最先进性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

Result: 实验表明，BOOST在合成和实际任务中均优于固定超参数的贝叶斯优化方法。

Conclusion: BOOST提供了一种简单有效的方法，自动化选择最优核函数和采集函数组合，显著提升贝叶斯优化性能。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

Result: Gibbs采样器和HMC能正确估计不确定性，MFVI不能，Laplace近似仅在大样本下有效。后验均值在小样本下优于MAP估计。

Conclusion: 后验采样对词嵌入的重要性得到了验证，尤其是在小样本情况下，Gibbs采样器在真实数据集上展示了可行性。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有INT4内核无法充分利用Blackwell架构FP4 Tensor Cores的问题，以实现更高的计算效率和精度。

Method: 提出MicroMix算法，结合MX数据格式和量化阈值，动态分配不同精度通道以平衡准确性和效率。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优异，比TensorRT-FP8快20%，并显著降低预填充延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: MicroMix在Blackwell架构上实现了高效且精确的量化推理，适用于多种LLMs。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的切片技术，用于Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)和融合扩展(FGW)距离，显著降低计算负担，同时保持等距不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW和FGW距离在比较异构数据时非常有用，但其计算复杂且基于非凸二次优化问题，现有切片方法受限于欧几里得几何且失去等距不变性。

Method: 基于1D最优传输(OT)的下界、分层OT和合适的积分规则，提出新的切片技术。

Result: 新方法显著减少计算量，保持等距不变性，适用于任意几何形状，并在形状检索和图同构测试中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 新切片距离不仅定义了一个伪度量，还在计算效率和鲁棒性上优于原始GW和FGW距离。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Motivation: 现有非均匀剪枝方法依赖人工设计策略，无法适应动态剪枝需求，且评估耗时。

Method: PPF利用性能预测器和智能代理实现实时剪枝决策，大幅减少评估时间。

Result: 实验显示PPF在动态和静态剪枝中分别减少困惑度33.4%和84.78%，评估速度提升64倍。

Conclusion: PPF高效、自适应，优于人工设计策略，适用于多种剪枝场景。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 传统谱嵌入方法在表达潜在结构特征方面存在局限性，无法充分捕捉变换域中的信息。

Method: 利用图分数傅里叶变换扩展了广义频率滤波嵌入（GEFFE），提出GEFRFE，结合图分数域滤波和非线性特征组合，并通过搜索优化和ResNet18自适应学习动态确定分数阶。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，GEFRFE能捕捉更丰富的结构特征，显著提升分类性能，同时保持与GEFFE相当的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: GEFRFE通过引入分数域信息，有效提升了谱嵌入的表达能力，为图表示学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Conclusion: $\epsilon$-softmax结合对称损失函数，在鲁棒性和学习效果间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is

Result: 在组织病理学数据集上的图像分类任务中，ASMR展示了有效的异常检测能力，并验证了动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR是一种实用且高效的联邦学习防御方法，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Result: 提出的方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，可以有效减少标签噪声并提升医学图像分析性能。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

TL;DR: AnalogCoder-Pro是一个基于多模态LLM的框架，用于自动化模拟电路设计，结合生成能力和优化技术，实现端到端的电路拓扑生成和器件尺寸优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟前端设计仍依赖专家经验和迭代仿真，缺乏全自动优化方法。LLM的发展为自动化设计提供了新可能，但现有研究尚未实现端到端的联合优化。

Method: 提出AnalogCoder-Pro框架，利用LLM生成电路拓扑并优化器件尺寸，结合拒绝采样和多模态诊断修复工作流。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了模拟电路设计的成功率和性能。

Conclusion: AnalogCoder-Pro为模拟电路设计自动化提供了有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

*Shunxian Gu,Chaoqun You,Bangbang Ren,Deke Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SplitMe框架通过分层联邦学习减少通信成本，优化资源分配，显著提升O-RAN中的模型训练效率和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决O-RAN中分层联邦学习因模型增大导致的训练时间延长和通信成本高的问题。

Method: 提出SplitMe框架，利用互学习交替训练模型和逆模型，消除频繁数据传输，并通过零阶技术整合最终模型。

Result: SplitMe在成本和收敛性上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed。

Conclusion: SplitMe有效解决了O-RAN中分层联邦学习的资源分配和通信成本问题，提升了训练效率。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JacobiNet是一种基于神经网络的坐标变换方法，解决了PINNs在解决PDE时的不规则边界问题，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在处理不规则边界时存在归一化不一致、边界条件执行不准确和损失项不平衡等问题，传统方法受限于简单几何和特定网格。

Method: JacobiNet通过学习连续可微的映射，利用轻量级MLP直接计算雅可比矩阵，无需网格化或显式计算雅可比矩阵。

Result: JacobiNet将相对L2误差从0.287-0.637降至0.013-0.039，平均精度提升18.3倍，在血管状域中预测精度提高3.65倍，速度提升10倍以上。

Conclusion: JacobiNet通过端到端可微的PDE求解，解决了PINNs的挑战，展示了其泛化能力、准确性和高效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次大规模系统比较了XAI方法在神经影像数据上的表现，发现常用方法（如GradCAM和LRP）存在系统性失败，而SmoothGrad表现更优，强调XAI方法需针对神经影像数据进行领域适配和验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型的可解释性对神经影像应用至关重要，但现有XAI方法缺乏严格验证，可能导致误解。

Method: 通过构建具有已知信号源的预测任务（如解剖特征和临床病变），提出新的XAI验证框架，并在约45,000张脑部MRI上进行大规模比较。

Result: GradCAM无法准确定位预测特征，LRP生成大量虚假解释；而SmoothGrad表现稳定，更适合神经影像数据。

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据进行领域适配，现有研究结果需重新评估，SmoothGrad是当前更可靠的选择。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

*Javier Fumanal-Idocin,Raquel Fernandez-Peralta,Javier Andreu-Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则系统的动态特征选择（DFS）方法，提高了决策的可解释性，并展示了其在性能和计算效率上的竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DFS方法使用不透明模型，限制了其在需要决策透明度的场景（如临床决策）中的应用。本文旨在通过规则系统提升DFS的可解释性。

Method: 采用基于规则的系统作为DFS的基础分类器，提供特征查询的不确定性量化，并通过约束特征搜索空间降低计算复杂度。

Result: 该方法在性能上与现有的贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了决策的透明度和实用性。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARGNN是一种自适应黎曼图神经网络框架，通过学习图的连续和各向异性黎曼度量张量场，动态适应图的复杂几何异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何GNN难以捕捉图中复杂的几何多样性，如树状层次结构和密集社区共存的情况。

Method: ARGNN通过参数化节点级度量张量，结合Ricci流正则化，学习局部最优几何结构。

Result: 在多种基准数据集上表现优异，并能自适应捕捉多样结构，同时提供可解释的几何洞察。

Conclusion: ARGNN统一了固定或混合曲率GNN，理论严谨且实践高效，为图结构分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域表格数据稀缺及传统生成方法在低数据量下表现不佳的问题，同时避免LLMs忽视数据依赖结构的缺陷。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1) 显式结构发现学习DAG；2) 用DAG引导LLM生成，确保数据依赖结构。

Result: StructSynth生成的数据在结构完整性和下游任务表现上优于现有方法，尤其在低数据量场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: StructSynth有效平衡隐私保护与数据保真度，为低数据量场景提供高质量合成数据。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Conclusion: 所提出的技术可应用于其他大规模工业模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

TL;DR: DeepKoopFormer结合Transformer和Koopman算子理论，提出了一种模块化的时间序列预测框架，具有稳定性和可解释性，并在多个实验中表现优于传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在噪声和动态不确定性下的可解释性和稳定性问题。

Method: 采用模块化的编码器-传播器-解码器结构，通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间中学习时间动态。

Result: 在合成系统、气候数据、金融时间序列和电力数据上表现优于LSTM和Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一个灵活、可解释且稳健的高维动态预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过少量数据和对抗训练发现独特的音频变换效果，为音频效果设计提供新方法。

Method: 采用Conditioning Aware Kernels（CAK）和AuGAN技术，前者通过软门机制保留输入特性，后者将对抗训练目标从真实性检测改为控制应用验证。

Result: 训练的卷积核表现出对角结构，能产生频率依赖的时间偏移，实现基于输入特性的音乐效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可从少量数据中发现音频变换效果，为音频设计开辟新途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在许多任务中表现出色，但其大规模计算和内存成本高昂。现有方法在低秩和稀疏结合上表现不佳，导致性能下降。

Conclusion: LOST是一种高效且性能优越的LLM预训练方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing
efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential
of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating
FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often
complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid
prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate
initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed
and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of
experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this
approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately
complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating
multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory
retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance
script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution
and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation.
This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows
while identifying critical areas for future development.

Conclusion: 双DRL框架可行且有效，为AI增强人类认知提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide
intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to
improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback
could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user
attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL
policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this
trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may
require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose
a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user
performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user
cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the
feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user
performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

### [383] [GPT Chatbots for Alleviating Anxiety and Depression: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial with Afghan Women](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00847)
*Sofia Sahab,Jawad Haqbeen,Diksha Sapkota,Takayuki Ito*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了GPT-4对阿富汗女性心理健康的影响，发现带有共情指令的GPT-4能显著降低焦虑和抑郁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿富汗女性面临多重挑战（如塔利班限制、社会不平等和家庭暴力），心理健康问题严重。研究旨在评估AI干预的潜力。

Method: 随机对照试验，60名参与者分为三组：GPT-4、带共情指令的GPT-4和支持性听众组。使用HADS量表测量干预前后的焦虑和抑郁，并进行语言分析。

Result: 支持性听众组的HADS分数显著降低，语言分析显示其语调更积极，语言风格匹配（LSM）更高，且LSM与HADS分数变化呈负相关。

Conclusion: AI驱动的干预（如GPT-4）可提供心理健康支持，但需与传统心理治疗结合以优化效果。

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effects of GPT-4, with and without
specific conversational instructions, on the mental health of Afghan women.
These women face multifaceted challenges, including Taliban-imposed
restrictions, societal inequalities, and domestic violence, adversely affecting
their well-being. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 60
participants, dividing them into three groups: GPT-4, a supportive listener
(GPT-4 with empathetic engagement instructions), and a waiting list. The
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure anxiety and
depression before and after the intervention. Linguistic analysis of chat data
examined personal pronouns, tones, emotions, and Language Style Matching (LSM).
The supportive listener group showed a significant reduction in HADS scores
compared to the other groups. Linguistic analysis revealed a more positive tone
and higher LSM in the supportive listener group, with a significant negative
correlation between LSM and changes in HADS scores, indicating greater
linguistic alignment was linked to reductions in anxiety and depression.
Perceived empathy ratings were also significantly higher in the supportive
listener group. These findings highlight the potential of AI-driven
interventions, like GPT-4, in providing accessible mental health support.
However, such interventions should complement traditional psychotherapy,
ensuring a collaborative approach to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: RestAware是一种基于24GHz FMCW雷达的非侵入式睡眠监测系统，解决了传统方法的舒适性、遮挡和隐私问题，分类准确率达92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统睡眠监测方法（如可穿戴设备、摄像头）存在舒适性差、遮挡失效和隐私问题，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 使用24GHz FMCW雷达和KNN分类器，结合大语言模型生成个性化睡眠报告。

Result: 在25名参与者中，系统对八种常见睡姿的分类准确率为92%，F1分数为0.91。

Conclusion: RestAware是一种低成本、保护隐私的实时睡眠监测方案，适用于智能家居和临床环境。

Abstract: Monitoring sleep posture and behavior is critical for diagnosing sleep
disorders and improving overall sleep quality. However, traditional approaches,
such as wearable devices, cameras, and pressure sensors, often compromise user
comfort, fail under obstructions like blankets, and raise privacy concerns. To
overcome these limitations, we present RestAware, a non-invasive, contactless
sleep monitoring system based on a 24GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave
(FMCW) radar. Our system is evaluated on 25 participants across eight common
sleep postures, achieving 92% classification accuracy and an F1-score of 0.91
using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. In addition, we integrate
instruction-tuned large language models (Mistral, Llama, and Falcon) to
generate personalized, human-readable sleep summaries from radar-derived
posture data. This low-cost ($ 35), privacy-preserving solution offers a
practical alternative for real-time deployment in smart homes and clinical
environments.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Gearshift Fellowship (GF) 是一种新的 Supertask 范式，旨在模拟人类和人工智能如何适应环境变化。结合认知神经科学、计算精神病学、经济学和人工智能，GF 通过计算神经认知建模和严肃游戏评估适应性行为机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类和人工智能在动态环境中如何调整行为（如坚持、放弃或改变策略），以理解认知-情感控制、学习风格和动机变化。

Method: 结合计算神经认知建模与严肃游戏，创建动态多任务环境，通过计算参数控制游戏环境以解释行为和探索机制。

Result: 在线研究（n=60）显示 GF 能复现传统神经心理学任务的效果，并揭示学习在不同情境下的新模式及临床特征与适应性行为的关联。

Conclusion: GF 是一个灵活的实验平台，可用于科学研究、临床干预和个体训练，促进自我调节学习、情绪和压力适应能力的发展。

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears?
Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed
to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment
demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry,
economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational
neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic,
multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior
across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior
and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional
tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across
perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as
a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes,
learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts
and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a
phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for
players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress
resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers
effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity),
uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how
clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way
for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to
cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem
designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual
growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines
co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VibeMesh是一种新型可穿戴系统，结合视觉和主动声学传感，用于高精度手部姿势和接触估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉遮挡、细微接触信号、仅视觉传感的局限性以及缺乏灵活触觉传感，准确估计手部姿势和接触事件具有挑战性。

Method: VibeMesh集成骨传导扬声器和稀疏压电麦克风，通过结构化声学信号传播推断接触变化，并使用基于图的注意力网络处理同步音频光谱和RGB-D手部网格。

Result: VibeMesh在遮挡或静态接触场景中优于仅视觉基线，表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VibeMesh为手部姿势和接触估计提供了一种轻量级、非侵入式的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学伦理审查模型在社会科学和人文学科中适用性有限，导致相关领域的伦理支持和培训不足。

Method: 利用宪法AI技术和协作提示开发方法，开发了EthicAlly原型系统，提供结合普遍伦理原则和情境化考量的结构化伦理评估。

Result: EthicAlly能辅助研究者设计伦理研究并准备伦理审查提交，同时减轻机构伦理委员会的负担。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补社会科学和人文学科伦理支持的空白，但不取代人类伦理监督。

Abstract: In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an
indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social
science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with
scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies
involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result,
tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the
necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and
low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can
meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by
presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics
support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on
constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development
methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates
both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations
relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical
research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can
also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting
to automate or replace human ethical oversight.

Motivation: 音乐活动对BLV人群有益，但目前缺乏系统性整理其技术设计知识的研究。

Method: 通过分类现有研究（技术类型和BLV人群参与程度），识别六类音乐技术和四大设计目标趋势。

Result: 提出四大设计洞察（空间感知、信息获取、非语言交流、记忆），并指出当前研究缺乏协作技术和实际场景测试。

Conclusion: 未来需更多实证研究，推动从‘可访问技术’到‘包容性技术’的转变。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review of music technology
tailored for blind and low vision (BLV) individuals. Music activities can be
particularly beneficial for BLV people. However, a systematic approach to
organizing knowledge on designing accessible technology for BLV people has yet
to be attempted. We categorize the existing studies based on the type of
technology and the extent of BLV people's involvement in the research. We
identify six main categories of BLV people-oriented music technology and
highlight four key trends in design goals. Based on these categories, we
propose four general insights focusing on (1) spatial awareness, (2) access to
information, (3) (non-verbal) communication, and (4) memory. The identified
trends suggest that more empirical studies involving BLV people in real-world
scenarios are needed to ensure that technological advancements can enhance
musical experiences and social inclusion. This research proposes collaborative
music technology and inclusive real-world testing with the target group as two
key areas missing in current research. They serve as a foundational step in
shifting the focus from ``accessible technology'' to ``inclusive technology''
for BLV individuals within the broader field of accessibility research.

Method: 使用VRChat平台，招募24名新手VR用户，收集一周内五天的数据。

Result: 第四天晕动症显著缓解，第五天场景变化导致症状加重。运动隧道技术在某些场景下效果有限。

Conclusion: 运动隧道技术对新手用户有效但有限，未来研究需进一步优化技术并探索其他缓解方法。

Abstract: Cybersickness significantly impacts the user experience in VR applications.
Locomotion tunneling is a widely adopted technique for mitigating cybersickness
in susceptible users. However, there is a lack of research investigating the
effects of prolonged use of locomotion tunneling among novice users. To fill
this gap, we used VRChat as our experimental platform. We recruited 24 novice
VR users, defined as participants with no prior experience using immersive
virtual environments. We collected five days of data within a one-week period.
The results indicated that participants exhibited significant mitigation to
cybersickness by Day 4. However, a change in the VR scene on Day 5 led to a
notable increase in cybersickness symptoms. Qualitative feedback revealed
participant-perceived causes of cybersickness and suggested that the
effectiveness of locomotion tunneling was limited in some scenarios. Finally,
we discussed the limitations of the study and proposed directions for future
research.

Motivation: 解决人工制作AD的高精度与AI生成的高效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过多模态大语言模型提示和人工编辑，支持社区协作（如分叉和编辑现有AD）。

Result: AI支持减少了重复工作，帮助专业人士保留风格选择，减轻新手认知负担。协作标签和变体显示了定制化、版本控制和培训新手的潜力。

Conclusion: 协作式AI辅助工具有潜力提升和扩展AD创作。

Abstract: Audio description (AD) makes video content accessible to millions of blind
and low vision (BLV) users. However, creating high-quality AD involves a
trade-off between the precision of human-crafted descriptions and the
efficiency of AI-generated ones. To address this, we present DescribePro a
collaborative AD authoring system that enables describers to iteratively refine
AI-generated descriptions through multimodal large language model prompting and
manual editing. DescribePro also supports community collaboration by allowing
users to fork and edit existing ADs, enabling the exploration of different
narrative styles. We evaluate DescribePro with 18 describers (9 professionals
and 9 novices) using quantitative and qualitative methods. Results show that AI
support reduces repetitive work while helping professionals preserve their
stylistic choices and easing the cognitive load for novices. Collaborative tags
and variations show potential for providing customizations, version control,
and training new describers. These findings highlight the potential of
collaborative, AI-assisted tools to enhance and scale AD authorship.

Motivation: 为快速原型设计和移动HCI应用提供紧凑、可复现的解决方案，避免依赖云基础设施。

Method: 集成CoreMotion（惯性感应）、MultipeerConnectivity（10Hz点对点数据传输）和CoreHaptics（触觉反馈），内置日志记录端到端延迟。

Result: 平均延迟70.4毫秒，95%延迟低于74毫秒；验证游戏KeepCalm在公共活动中表现稳定，零丢包，功耗低（24mW）。

Conclusion: 系统代码简洁（少于500行Swift），开源MIT许可，为交互研究、游戏和教育工具提供基础。

Abstract: We introduce an open-source, fully offline pipeline that transforms a
consumer-grade iPhone into a motion controller with real-time tactile feedback,
using only native Apple frameworks. Designed for rapid prototyping and applied
mobile HCI scenarios, the system integrates CoreMotion for inertial sensing,
MultipeerConnectivity for peer-to-peer data transmission at 10 Hz, and
CoreHaptics for immediate tactile confirmation. A built-in logger captures
end-to-end latency without requiring clock synchronization, yielding a mean
delay of 70.4 ms and 95th percentile below 74 ms on typical 5 GHz Wi-Fi (-55
dBm RSSI). We validated the pipeline through a real-time demonstrator game,
KeepCalm, deployed during a public event with 21 participants. Results showed
stable connections, zero packet loss, and negligible power impact (24 mW on
iPhone 13 mini). With fewer than 500 lines of Swift code and no reliance on
cloud infrastructure, this system provides a compact, reproducible foundation
for embodied interaction research, casual games, and offline educational tools.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过振幅调制技术在人脸上呈现纯低频振动的方法，解决了小型振动器无法实现的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于面部缺乏感知高频振动的Pacinian小体，传统方法无法直接呈现低频振动。

Method: 利用约200Hz的载波频率进行振幅调制，使面部仅感知原始低频信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在额头和面部其他区域（如眼睛、脸颊和下唇）有效呈现低频振动。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在面部呈现纯低频振动的目标，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to present pure low-frequency vibration
sensations to the face that cannot be presented by small commercially available
vibrators. The core innovation lies in utilizing an amplitude modulation
technique with a carrier frequency of approximately 200 Hz. Due to the absence
of Pacinian corpuscles in the facial region - receptors responsible for
detecting high-frequency vibrations around 200 Hz - only the original
low-frequency signal is perceived. Three experiments were conducted.
Experiments 1 and 2 were performed on the forehead to confirm that the proposed
amplitude modulation method could produce the desired low-frequency perception
and to evaluate the subjective quality of the vibration. The results suggested
that the proposed method could produce the perception of desired pure
low-frequency vibration when applied to the forehead. In Experiment 3, the
proposed method was applied to the whole face, and its range of applicability
was explored. The results indicated that the original low-frequency vibration
was clearly perceptible around the eyes, cheeks, and lower lip area.

Result: 用户对机器人的角色认知、对话互动及旁观者遭遇表现出积极反馈。

Conclusion: LLM赋能的机器人叙事能力可增强远程探索体验，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Robotic telepresence enables users to navigate and experience remote
environments. However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on
users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these
systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating
location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support
remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that
provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place
through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology
museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our
findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in
the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work
demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver
location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote
environments.

Motivation: 现有方法主要帮助用户理解脚本逻辑和发现问题，而非直接验证正确性。ViseGPT 旨在通过自动生成测试用例和直观反馈，优化调试流程。

Method: 开发 ViseGPT，自动提取用户提示中的约束生成测试用例，验证脚本可靠性，并将结果转化为甘特图。设计基于用户研究（N=8），并通过用户研究（N=18）评估效果。

Result: ViseGPT 显著提升了调试效率，增强了用户发现和修正问题的能力，优化了工作流程体验。

Conclusion: ViseGPT 通过自动化测试和直观反馈，有效解决了 LLM 生成脚本的验证问题，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable the rapid generation of data wrangling
scripts based on natural language instructions, but these scripts may not fully
adhere to user-specified requirements, necessitating careful inspection and
iterative refinement. Existing approaches primarily assist users in
understanding script logic and spotting potential issues themselves, rather
than providing direct validation of correctness. To enhance debugging
efficiency and optimize the user experience, we develop ViseGPT, a tool that
automatically extracts constraints from user prompts to generate comprehensive
test cases for verifying script reliability. The test results are then
transformed into a tailored Gantt chart, allowing users to intuitively assess
alignment with semantic requirements and iteratively refine their scripts. Our
design decisions are informed by a formative study (N=8) that explores user
practices and challenges. We further evaluate the effectiveness and usability
of ViseGPT through a user study (N=18). Results indicate that ViseGPT
significantly improves debugging efficiency for LLM-generated data-wrangling
scripts, enhances users' ability to detect and correct issues, and streamlines
the workflow experience.

Result: AR支持的试错法提升了老年人的学习体验，增强了认知参与度和探索未知操作的信心。

Conclusion: AR试错法是一种有效的老年人学习工具，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Older adults tend to encounter challenges when learning to use new smartphone
apps due to age-related cognitive and physical changes. Compared to traditional
support methods such as video tutorials, trial-and-error allows older adults to
learn to use smartphone apps by making and correcting mistakes. However, it
remains unknown how trial-and-error should be designed to empower older adults
to use smartphone apps and how well it would work for older adults. Informed by
the guidelines derived from prior work, we designed and implemented ExplorAR,
an AR-based trial-and-error system that offers real-time and situated visual
guidance in the augmented space around the smartphone to empower older adults
to explore and correct mistakes independently. We conducted a user study with
18 older adults to compare ExplorAR with traditional video tutorials and a
simplified version of ExplorAR. Results show that the AR-supported
trial-and-error method enhanced older adults' learning experience by fostering
deeper cognitive engagement and improving confidence in exploring unknown
operations.

Result: 实验显示AffectGPT-R1在开放词汇多模态情感识别任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了多模态情感识别领域的发展，代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) aims to predict
emotions without being constrained by predefined label spaces, enabling
fine-grained and human-like emotion understanding. Unlike traditional
discriminative methods, OV-MER leverages generative models, such as large
language models (LLMs) with extensive vocabularies, to capture the full
spectrum of emotions. Previous approaches (like AffectGPT) primarily rely on
token-level loss for training. However, this objective does not align with the
emotion wheel (EW)-based evaluation metrics used in OV-MER. Unfortunately,
EW-based metrics cannot be directly optimized via gradient backpropagation. In
this paper, we propose AffectGPT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that
directly optimizes performance on EW-based metrics. Specifically, we treat
these metrics as the reward function and employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to maximize rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that
AffectGPT-R1 achieves significant improvements on OV-MER. We hope this work
advances the field of multimodal emotion recognition. Our code will be publicly
available at:https://github.com/zeroQiaoba/AffectGPT.

Result: 开发了一种上下文敏感、认知上有意义的解释方法，提升AI决策的透明度和可信度。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI系统提供了一种新的、更直观的人类中心解释范式，结合了认知科学与可解释AI。

Abstract: Explainability remains a critical challenge in artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, particularly in high stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and
decision support, where users must understand and trust automated reasoning.
Traditional explainability methods such as feature importance and post-hoc
justifications often fail to capture the cognitive processes that underlie
human decision making, leading to either too technical or insufficiently
meaningful explanations. We propose a novel appraisal based framework inspired
by the Component Process Model (CPM) for explainability to address this gap.
While CPM has traditionally been applied to emotion research, we use its
appraisal component as a cognitive model for generating human aligned
explanations. By structuring explanations around key appraisal dimensions such
as relevance, implications, coping potential, and normative significance our
framework provides context sensitive, cognitively meaningful justifications for
AI decisions. This work introduces a new paradigm for generating intuitive,
human-centred explanations in AI driven systems by bridging cognitive science
and explainable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高等教育中较少使用代金券激励，本研究旨在探索其在网络安全教育中的潜力。

Method: 采用100%基于任务的评估策略，设计高难度任务（如获取行业证书）并提供代金券激励。

Result: 调查和访谈显示代金券激励显著影响学生的职业志向。

Conclusion: 建议在网络安全或更广泛的ICT教育中采用代金券激励。

Abstract: While voucher incentives have been popular for primary and secondary schools,
they are less used in higher education. In this study, we leverage industry
voucher incentives to inspire students in cybersecurity education (CSE). We
adopt a 100% portfolio-based assessment strategy, where students can freely
select their target grades in the investigated unit. We purposely design one of
the high distinction (HD) tasks to be obtaining an industry certificate and
provide vouchers to those who can accomplish a predefined set of tasks before a
midpoint. The voucher recipients will use the voucher to access the industry
certificate training materials and sit the certificate exam for free. Passing
the certificate exam is one of the conditions for gaining an HD grade. Our
survey and interviews reveal a substantial influence of voucher incentives on
students' career aspirations. In light of the findings, recommendations on
adopting voucher incentives in CSE or broader ICT education are offered for
institutions and researchers.

ChatGPT-3.5. The two models were generally favored over human responses, while
their strengths in coverage and breadth, and emphasis on technical and
task-oriented visualization feedback collectively shaped higher overall
quality. Based on our findings, we draw implications for advancing user
experiences based on the potential of LLMs and human perception over their
capabilities, with relevance to broader applications of AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如日记、访谈）因稀疏采样和结构化格式无法直接估计日常压力源频率，需改进方法以更准确捕捉压力暴露。

Method: 采用100天实地研究，68名参与者通过穿戴设备触发提示和自由格式报告压力源，开发渐近模型解决样本稀疏和偏差问题。

Result: 平均每人每天经历5.39次压力，前三类为工作（1.76/天）、健康（0.59/天）和交通（0.55/天）。

Conclusion: 研究提供了压力源频率的基准，有助于心理健康治疗和干预的参考。

Abstract: Understanding how frequently people experience different kinds of daily
stressors is crucial for interpreting stress exposure and informing mental
health care. But it can't be directly estimated from current assessment
methods, such as diaries, end-of-day interviews, and ecological momentary
assessments (EMA), that use sparse sampling to limit participant burden, and a
structured response format for uniformity. In this paper, we utilize stressor
data collected in a 100-day field study with 68 participants that adopted
wearable-triggered prompts and a freeform format to solicit stressors soon
after they occurred, but limited its prompts to a small subset to keep the
burden low. We develop asymptotic models to estimate the latent frequency of
different kinds of real-life stressors that address sample sparsity and
sampling bias. We find that people experience 5.39 stressors per day, on
average. The top three are related to work (1.76/day), health (0.59/day), and
transportation (0.55/day). These estimates offer a principled benchmark for
interpreting individual stressor loads. They can also inform mental health care
treatments and interventions by establishing population-level baselines.

Result: 高人类相似度头像引发负面情绪，中等相似度的可爱头像对情感感知有积极影响。

Conclusion: 头像的人类相似度、可爱度和自然面部状态是影响情感感知的重要因素，对商业和咨询等应用有实践意义。

Abstract: An increasing number of online interaction settings now provide the
possibility to visually represent oneself via an animated avatar instead of a
video stream. Benefits include protecting the communicator's privacy while
still providing a means to express their individuality. In consequence, there
has been a surge in means for avatar-based personalization, ranging from
classic human representations to animals, food items, and more. However, using
avatars also has drawbacks. Depending on the human-likeness of the avatar and
the corresponding disparities between the avatar and the original expresser,
avatars may elicit discomfort or even hinder effective nonverbal communication
by distorting emotion perception. This study examines the relationship between
the human-likeness of virtual avatars and emotion perception for Ekman's six
"basic emotions". Research reveals that avatars with varying degrees of
human-likeness have distinct effects on emotion perception. High human-likeness
avatars, such as human avatars, tend to elicit more negative emotional
responses from users, a phenomenon that is consistent with the concept of
Uncanny Valley in aesthetics, which suggests that closely resembling humans can
provoke negative emotional responses. Conversely, a raccoon avatar and a shark
avatar, known as cuteness, which exhibit moderate human similarity in this
study, demonstrate a positive influence on emotion perception. Our initial
results suggest that the human-likeness of avatars is an important factor for
emotion perception. The results from the follow-up study further suggest that
the cuteness of avatars and their natural facial status may also play a
significant role in emotion perception and elicitation. We discuss practical
implications for strategically conveying specific human behavioral messages
through avatars in multiple applications, such as business and counseling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需物理交互的二维内容导航技术，适用于VR环境中的图像浏览、地图探索等场景。

Method: 通过实时头部追踪实现缩放和平移，比较了三种交互模式（Static、Tilt Zoom、Parallel Zoom）在空间、误差和主观指标上的表现。

Result: Parallel Zoom显著减少了头部运动，用户反馈其疲劳感更低，适合长时间或精确任务。

Conclusion: HeadZoom通过优化头部运动需求，提升了无手交互的效率和舒适性，为VR中的图像探索提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{HeadZoom}, a hands-free interaction technique for
navigating two-dimensional visual content using head movements. The system
enables fluid zooming and panning by only using real-time head tracking. It
supports natural control in applications such as map exploration, radiograph
inspection, and image browsing, particularly where physical interaction is
limited. We evaluated HeadZoom in a within-subjects user study comparing three
interaction techniques-Static, Tilt Zoom, and Parallel Zoom-across spatial,
error, and subjective metrics. Results show that Parallel Zoom significantly
reduced total head movement compared to Static and Tilt modes. Users reported
significantly lower perceived exertion for Parallel Zoom, confirming its
suitability for prolonged or precision-based tasks. By minimising movement
demands while maintaining task effectiveness, HeadZoom advances the design of
head-based 2D interaction in VR, creating new opportunities for immersive,
accessible, and hands-free systems for image exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AR中虚拟物体缺乏物理性导致的声音交互不自然问题，提升多感官体验的真实性。

Method: 利用计算机视觉识别和分割真实物体的材料，结合物理建模合成实时生成材料相关声音。

Result: 用户研究表明，材料相关声音显著提升了交互真实感，并帮助用户更准确区分相似材料。

Conclusion: 材料感知的声音交互增强了AR的沉浸感和现实感知。

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects.
However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of
natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no
sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory
experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality
(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback
of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that
dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual
congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in
AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer
vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's
physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to
generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.
In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based
sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of
non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that
material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.
Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar
materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings
show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a
stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world
surroundings.

Motivation: 解决AI在实时交互中协助时机和频率的难题，避免用户因冗余协助而失去长期参与度。

Method: 采用部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）建模用户潜在认知状态，结合反事实推理权衡协助效果与用户参与度。

Result: 模拟实验显示，该自适应策略显著优于始终提供或不提供协助的基准策略。

Conclusion: 优化AI协助策略需平衡短期决策准确性与长期用户参与度，避免用户疲劳并保持其对AI指导的接受度。

Abstract: AI systems and technologies that can interact with humans in real time face a
communication dilemma: when to offer assistance and how frequently. Overly
frequent or contextually redundant assistance can cause users to disengage,
undermining the long-term benefits of AI assistance. We introduce a cognitive
modeling framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) that addresses this timing challenge by inferring a user's latent
cognitive state related to AI engagement over time. Additionally, our framework
incorporates reasoning about the long-term effects of AI assistance, explicitly
aiming to avoid actions that could lead the human user to disengage or
deactivate the AI. A key component of our approach is counterfactual reasoning:
at each time step, the AI considers how well the user would perform
independently and weighs the potential boost in performance against the risk of
diminishing engagement with the AI. Through simulations, we show that this
adaptive strategy significantly outperforms baseline policies in which
assistance is always provided or never provided. Our results highlight the
importance of balancing short-term decision accuracy with sustained user
engagement, showing how communication strategies can be optimized to avoid
alert fatigue while preserving the user's receptiveness to AI guidance.

Motivation: 现代环境中久坐活动增多，现有体姿估计方法存在遮挡、隐私和舒适性限制，需要一种更灵活、隐私友好的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段生成模型，基于压力映射，结合椅子形态进行推理，并通过物理驱动的数据增强提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: ChairPose为姿势感知交互系统开辟了新设计空间，适用于人体工学、医疗和自适应界面。

Abstract: Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments,
raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of
responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as
vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion,
privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We
introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation
system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of
chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on
pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the
inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving
pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we
introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic
variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and
four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of
89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust
generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the
design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications
in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

Motivation: 为了在视觉搜索任务中更有效地辅助人类，需要区分导航意图和信息意图。先前方法存在固定搜索时间和依赖用户特定数据的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种跨用户预测方法，结合EEG和眼动追踪数据，用户自主决定搜索时间。

Result: 在留一用户评估中达到84.5%的准确率，接近用户内预测准确率（85.5%），但更具灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需用户特定训练数据的情况下，实现了高效的意图识别，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks,
they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene
(navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent).
Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e.,
without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to
real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work
used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark
contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.
Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios
that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is
impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first
publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.
informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We
present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG
and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out
evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but
offering much greater flexibility

Motivation: 风格化3D角色动画在多个领域应用广泛，但制作过程耗时耗力，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过单视角人类视频和风格化3D角色输入，捕捉并转移动作，结合交互模块和创作工具实现用户自定义。

Result: 问卷研究和案例研究表明，该系统能生成自然且多样的风格化3D角色动画。

Conclusion: 该框架为风格化3D角色动画提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: With captivating visual effects, stylized 3D character animation has gained
widespread use in cinematic production, advertising, social media, and the
potential development of virtual reality (VR) non-player characters (NPCs).
However, animating stylized 3D characters often requires significant time and
effort from animators. We propose a mixed-initiative framework and interactive
system to enable stylized 3D characters to mimic motion in human videos. The
framework takes a single-view human video and a stylized 3D character (the
target character) as input, captures the motion of the video, and then
transfers the motion to the target character. In addition, it involves two
interaction modules for customizing the result. Accordingly, the system
incorporates two authoring tools that empower users with intuitive
modification. A questionnaire study offers tangible evidence of the framework's
capability of generating natural stylized 3D character animations similar to
the motion in the video. Additionally, three case studies demonstrate the
utility of our approach in creating diverse results.

Result: 显著值和刻度对齐显著影响任务表现。

Conclusion: 可视化设计需基于数据和设计因素对感知机制的影响进行优化。

Abstract: We explore the effects of data and design considerations through the example
case of part-to-whole data relationships. Standard part-to-whole
representations like pie charts and stacked bar charts make the relationships
of parts to the whole explicit. Value estimation in these charts benefits from
two perceptual mechanisms: anchoring, where the value is close to a reference
value with an easily recognized shape, and alignment where the beginning or end
of the shape is aligned with a marker. In an online study, we explore how data
and design factors such as value, position, and encoding together impact these
effects in making estimations in part-to-whole charts. The results show how
salient values and alignment to positions on a scale affect task performance.
This demonstrates the need for informed visualization design based around how
data properties and design factors affect perceptual mechanisms.

Result: 支持多种典型和非典型传感器放置，实现高精度姿态估计和活动识别。

Conclusion: IMUCoCo显著提升了IMU的灵活性和适应性，支持用户自定义设备放置。

Abstract: IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and
estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in
predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors
and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the
increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited
adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few
well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we
rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured
from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates
(IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs
placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial
coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose
estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo
supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical
sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of
IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place
their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The
framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the
context and suggests placement depending on the use case.

Abstract: Synthetic images, audio, and video can now be generated and edited by
Artificial Intelligence (AI). In particular, the malicious use of synthetic
data has raised concerns about potential harms to cybersecurity, personal
privacy, and public trust. Although AI-based detection tools exist to help
identify synthetic content, their limitations often lead to user mistrust and
confusion between real and fake content. This study examines the role of AI
performance in influencing human trust and decision making in synthetic data
identification. Through an online human subject experiment involving 400

Result: 研究验证了发言量分析在小中型企业周会中的有效性，展示了不同部门间的发言量差异。

Conclusion: 发言量分析为人力资本可视化提供了新视角，有助于提升组织沟通与创新。

Abstract: In recent years, many companies have recognized the importance of human
resources and are investing in human capital to revitalize their organizations
and enhance internal communication, thereby fostering innovation. However,
conventional quantification methods have mainly focused on readily measurable
indicators without addressing the fundamental role of conversations in human
capital. This study focuses on routine meetings and proposes strategies to
visualize human capital by analyzing speech amount during these meetings. We
employ conversation visualization technology, which operates effectively, to
quantify speech. We then measure differences in speech amount by attributes
such as gender and job post, changes in speech amount depending on whether
certain participants are present, and correlations between speech amount and
continuous attributes. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we
analyzed speech amounts by departmental affiliation during weekly meetings at
small to medium enterprises.

Motivation: 现有方法假设数据完整或缺乏动态适应性，无法应对现实中的动态模态不完整和异步问题。

Method: 采用双层次专家结构：模态专家库通过软路由动态处理缺失模态，情感专家库通过差分注意力路由关注情感原型。此外，跨模态对齐模块解决模态间的时序和语义不一致。

Conclusion: Hi-MoE框架显著提升了智能情感系统在复杂现实环境中的适应性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for human-computer
interaction, yet real-world challenges like dynamic modality incompleteness and
asynchrony severely limit its robustness. Existing methods often assume
consistently complete data or lack dynamic adaptability. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hi-MoE~(Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts)
framework for robust continuous emotion prediction. This framework employs a
dual-layer expert structure. A Modality Expert Bank utilizes soft routing to
dynamically handle missing modalities and achieve robust information fusion. A
subsequent Emotion Expert Bank leverages differential-attention routing to
flexibly attend to emotional prototypes, enabling fine-grained emotion
representation. Additionally, a cross-modal alignment module explicitly
addresses temporal shifts and semantic inconsistencies between modalities.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets DEAP and DREAMER demonstrate our
model's state-of-the-art performance in continuous emotion regression,
showcasing exceptional robustness under challenging conditions such as dynamic
modality absence and asynchronous sampling. This research significantly
advances the development of intelligent emotion systems adaptable to complex

Result: 消融实验验证了管道组件的有效性。用户研究表明，与无建议的基线相比，EchoLadder显著提升了用户在空间设计中的创造力。

Conclusion: EchoLadder不仅提升了设计效率，还揭示了AI辅助下用户的渐进式设计策略，为未来系统提供了设计启示。

Abstract: Mixed reality platforms allow users to create virtual environments, yet
novice users struggle with both ideation and execution in spatial design. While
existing AI models can automatically generate scenes based on user prompts, the
lack of interactive control limits users' ability to iteratively steer the
output. In this paper, we present EchoLadder, a novel human-AI collaboration
pipeline that leverages large vision-language model (LVLM) to support
interactive scene modification in virtual reality. EchoLadder accepts users'
verbal instructions at varied levels of abstraction and spatial specificity,
generates concrete design suggestions throughout a progressive design process.
The suggestions can be automatically applied, regenerated and retracted by
users' toggle control.Our ablation study showed effectiveness of our pipeline
components. Our user study found that, compared to baseline without showing
suggestions, EchoLadder better supports user creativity in spatial design. It
also contributes insights on users' progressive design strategies under AI
assistance, providing design implications for future systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出数据增强技术，通过生成和标注图表对，扩展可视化知识库的覆盖范围和准确性，并在Draco知识库中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可视化知识库的训练数据缺乏全面性和系统性，限制了其推理和推荐能力。

Method: 提出生成新颖图表对的方法，包括设计排列和识别未充分评估的特征，并比较多种标注方法以扩展标注规模。

Result: 方法显著提升了特征覆盖范围和图表推荐性能。

Conclusion: 数据增强技术能有效改进可视化知识库的覆盖范围和准确性。

Abstract: Visualization knowledge bases enable computational reasoning and
recommendation over a visualization design space. These systems evaluate design
trade-offs using numeric weights assigned to different features (e.g., binning
a variable). Feature weights can be learned automatically by fitting a model to
a collection of chart pairs, in which one chart is deemed preferable to the
other. To date, labeled chart pairs have been drawn from published empirical
research results; however, such pairs are not comprehensive, resulting in a
training corpus that lacks many design variants and fails to systematically
assess potential trade-offs. To improve knowledge base coverage and accuracy,
we contribute data augmentation techniques for generating and labeling chart
pairs. We present methods to generate novel chart pairs based on design
permutations and by identifying under-assessed features -- leading to an
expanded corpus with thousands of new chart pairs, now in need of labels.
Accordingly, we next compare varied methods to scale labeling efforts to
annotate chart pairs, in order to learn updated feature weights. We evaluate
our methods in the context of the Draco knowledge base, demonstrating
improvements to both feature coverage and chart recommendation performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过技术（如凝视和语音交互）提升老年人基于照片的回忆体验，以改善其福祉。

Method: 通过专家访谈了解老年人使用LLM技术进行照片回忆的挑战，开发了结合眼动追踪和自然语言交互的系统Eye2Recall，并进行用户研究。

Result: 用户研究表明，Eye2Recall能更好地适应老年人的自然交互模式，提升回忆体验。

Conclusion: 研究为未来设计更易用、更符合老年人需求的回忆技术提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Photo-based reminiscence has the potential to have a positive impact on older
adults' reconnection with their personal history and improve their well-being.
Supporting reminiscence in older adults through technological implementations
is becoming an increasingly important area of research in the fields of HCI and
CSCW. However, the impact of integrating gaze and speech as mixed-initiative
interactions in LLM-powered reminiscence conversations remains under-explored.
To address this, we conducted expert interviews to understand the challenges
that older adults face with LLM-powered, photo-based reminiscence experiences.
Based on these design considerations, we developed Eye2Recall, a system that
integrates eye tracking for detecting visual interest with natural language
interaction to create a mixed-initiative reminiscence experience. We evaluated
its effectiveness through a user study involving ten older adults. The results
have important implications for the future design of more accessible and
empowering reminiscence technologies that better align with older adults'
natural interaction patterns and enhance their positive aging.

TL;DR: mCardiacDx是一种基于雷达的无接触系统，用于心律失常监测和诊断，通过精确目标定位技术和编码器-解码器模型解决信号空间和时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心律失常监测方法依赖专业医疗设备和接触式设备，存在不便和局限性，而无接触监测技术对心律失常患者的信号分析效果不佳。

Method: 提出mCardiacDx系统，结合精确目标定位（PTL）技术和编码器-解码器模型，从反射信号中重建心脉搏波形。

Result: 在健康受试者和心律失常患者的大规模数据集中，mCardiacDx和PTL技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: mCardiacDx为心律失常的无接触监测和诊断提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe
complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is
essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as
electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on
specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature.
Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face
significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia
patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.
  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system
that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse
waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our
work include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates
reflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model
that transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.
Our evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients
shows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in
arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in
healthy subjects.

Motivation: 探索影响用户对任务导向和探索性交互偏好的因素，以改进CRS设计。

Method: 采用被试内设计（N=139），参与者体验两种脚本化CRS对话，评估体验并评价系统质量。

Result: 逻辑回归显示探索性偏好受享受感、实用性、新颖性和对话质量影响；聚类分析发现五种用户画像；年龄、性别和控制偏好显著影响选择。

Conclusion: 研究整合了情感、认知和特质层面的预测因子，为动态适应用户需求的对话设计提供了框架。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised
recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly
support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors
shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this
within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS
dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight
system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the
exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and
conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also
associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user
profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses
indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced
these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level
predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive,
value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework
applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with
evolving user needs.

*Matouš Jelínek,Nadine Schlicker,Ewart de Visser*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了六条设计准则，旨在帮助设计师优化自动化系统的信任度评估，从而促进伦理和负责任的人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保用户对自动化系统信任度的准确评估，使其感知与实际信任度一致，从而做出明智的依赖决策。

Method: 基于多学科文献（如人机交互、认知心理学、伦理学等）和语用学原则（如共同基础和格莱斯沟通准则），提出六条设计准则。

Result: 准则为设计师提供了可操作的见解，以创建能提供相关信任度线索的系统，促进校准信任和更安全的人机交互。

Conclusion: 这些准则不仅能指导设计，还可作为评估现有系统信任度评估能力的工具。

Abstract: Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for
their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a
system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is
factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate
trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's
trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make
informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system
(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers
optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and
responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived
from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,
cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.
We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically
the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication
maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated
systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped
by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal
norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or
scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed
guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated
systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally
foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe
interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed
heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems
enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线调查中因缺乏个人参与感和责任感导致的随意回答和满足最低要求的问题。

Method: 采用AI驱动的视频生成、语音识别和大语言模型，设计了一项对比研究，80名参与者分别与具身代理或聊天机器人互动。

Result: 具身代理显著提升了回答的详细度和参与效率，但对满意度无显著影响，原因包括个人偏好、对话延迟和恐怖谷效应。

Conclusion: 支持开发更接近人类互动的具身代理，以提升在线调查的自然性和效果。

Abstract: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly more realistic and
capable of dynamic conversations. In online surveys, anthropomorphic agents
could help address issues like careless responding and satisficing, which
originate from the lack of personal engagement and perceived accountability.
However, there is a lack of understanding of how ECAs in user experience
research may affect participant engagement, satisfaction, and the quality of
responses. As a proof of concept, we propose an instrument that enables the
incorporation of conversations with a virtual avatar into surveys, using on
AI-driven video generation, speech recognition, and Large Language Models. In
our between-subjects study, 80 participants (UK, stratified random sample of
general population) either talked to a voice-based agent with an animated video
avatar, or interacted with a chatbot. Across surveys based on two self-reported
psychometric tests, 2,265 conversation responses were obtained. Statistical
comparison of results indicates that embodied agents can contribute
significantly to more informative, detailed responses, as well as higher yet
more time-efficient engagement. Furthermore, qualitative analysis provides
valuable insights for causes of no significant change to satisfaction, linked
to personal preferences, turn-taking delays and Uncanny Valley reactions. These
findings support the pursuit and development of new methods toward human-like
agents for the transformation of online surveys into more natural interactions
resembling in-person interviews.

Result: 通过用户调查评估工具的可扩展性和灵活性，证明其能简化知识图谱探索。

Conclusion: InK Browser利用本体信息，有效提升知识图谱的导航和可视化能力。

Abstract: Navigating, visualizing, and discovery in graph data is frequently a
difficult prospect. This is especially true for knowledge graphs (KGs), due to
high number of possible labeled connections to other data.
  However, KGs are frequently equipped with an ontology as a schema. That is,
it informs how the relationships between data may be constrained. This
additional information can be leveraged to improve how (knowledge) graph data
can be navigated, visualized, or otherwise utilized in a discovery process.
  In this manuscript, we introduce the Interactive Knowledge (InK) Browser.
This tool specifically takes advantage ontological information (i.e.,
knowledge) when found in KGs. Specifically, we use modular views that provide
various perspectives over the graph, including an interactive schema view, data
listings based on type, neighborhood connections, and geospatial depiction
(where appropriate). For this manuscript, we have evaluated the basic premise
of this tool over a user group ($n= With this grown user survey, we continue to
evaluate how scalable tools, including flexible views, can make KG exploration
easier for a range of applications.)

showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic
identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved
participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight
that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers

Motivation: 计算机感知技术为个性化医疗提供了机会，但也引发了隐私、偏见和人文关怀的担忧，需要全面了解利益相关者的观点。

Method: 通过102名利益相关者的半结构化访谈，进行主题分析，包括患者、临床医生、技术开发者和学者。

Result: 识别了七个关键问题领域，并提出了“个性化路线图”作为解决方案。

Conclusion: “个性化路线图”为开发者和政策制定者提供了实用框架，以平衡技术应用与人文关怀。

Abstract: Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective
computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented
opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy,
bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A
comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation
challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in
real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first
evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational,
technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP
technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers,
frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or
philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a
multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and
consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern
domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific
relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance;
(5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7)
philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic
safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that
predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared,
thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies
between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these
insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for
developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous
behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.

Motivation: 传统手术技能培训依赖专家反馈，但资源有限且主观性强，AI驱动的自动化评估可能提升学习效果。

Method: 开发基于XAI的模拟训练框架，通过视频分析提取技能指标，提供个性化反馈。

Result: XAI反馈改善了认知负荷和学员信心，虽未显著缩小表现差距，但学员更接近专家操作。

Conclusion: 可解释AI在手术教育中有潜力，需进一步研究数据驱动的自适应反馈机制。

Abstract: Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet
direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective
assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of
personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of
self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning
have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility
of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill
acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI
(XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We
create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze
videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our
intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee
performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal
execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a
prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of
XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes,
cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results
showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no
differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps
or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects
where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages
the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of
data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning
experiences and competency assessment.

TL;DR: PunchPulse是一款专为盲人和低视力（BLV）人群设计的VR拳击游戏，旨在通过丰富的感官反馈和空间导航支持，提升他们的体育活动水平。经过七个月的多阶段研究，该游戏显著提高了用户的运动强度和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLV人群因缺乏可访问且有趣的运动选择，体育活动水平较低。现有解决方案依赖听觉提示，但缺乏丰富的感官反馈和空间导航支持，效果有限。

Method: 研究通过三个阶段进行：与三名BLV共同设计者迭代改进PunchPulse，两名早期测试者提供反馈，六名BLV用户参与最终评估。数据收集包括定性和定量指标。

Result: 所有参与者均达到中等至高强度体育活动（MVPA）水平，表现出高度的沉浸感和参与度。

Conclusion: PunchPulse展示了VR作为包容性媒介的潜力，填补了BLV群体在可访问、高强度运动干预方面的空白。

Abstract: Blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals experience lower levels of physical
activity (PA) compared to sighted peers due to a lack of accessible, engaging
exercise options. Existing solutions often rely on auditory cues but do not
fully integrate rich sensory feedback or support spatial navigation, limiting
their effectiveness. This study introduces PunchPulse, a virtual reality (VR)
boxing exergame designed to motivate BLV users to reach and sustain moderate to
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels. Over a seven-month, multi-phased
study, PunchPulse was iteratively refined with three BLV co-designers, informed
by two early pilot testers, and evaluated by six additional BLV user-study
participants. Data collection included both qualitative (researcher
observations, SOPI) and quantitative (MVPA zones, aid usage, completion times)
measures of physical exertion and gameplay performance. The user study revealed
that all participants reached moderate MVPA thresholds, with high levels of
immersion and engagement observed. This work demonstrates the potential of VR
as an inclusive medium for promoting meaningful PA in the BLV community and
addresses a critical gap in accessible, intensity-driven exercise
interventions.

Conclusion: 新模式系统为可视化设计提供了新的机会，并与地图和制图学的理论建立了联系。

Abstract: We present a new comprehensive theory for explaining, exploring, and using
pattern as a visual variable in visualization. Although patterns have long been
used for data encoding and continue to be valuable today, their conceptual
foundations are precarious: the concepts and terminology used across the
research literature and in practice are inconsistent, making it challenging to
use patterns effectively and to conduct research to inform their use. To
address this problem, we conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary literature
review that clarifies ambiguities around the use of "pattern" and "texture". As
a result, we offer a new consistent treatment of pattern as a composite visual
variable composed of structured groups of graphic primitives that can serve as
marks for encoding data individually and collectively. This new and widely
applicable formulation opens a sizable design space for the visual variable
pattern, which we formalize as a new system comprising three sets of variables:
the spatial arrangement of primitives, the appearance relationships among
primitives, and the retinal visual variables that characterize individual
primitives. We show how our pattern system relates to existing visualization
theory and highlight opportunities for visualization design. We further explore
patterns based on complex spatial arrangements, demonstrating explanatory power
and connecting our conceptualization to broader theory on maps and cartography.
