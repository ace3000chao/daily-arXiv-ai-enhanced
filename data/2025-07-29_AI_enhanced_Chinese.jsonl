While these\nsystems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and\ncreativity - they present a fundamental \"comfort-growth paradox\": AI's\nuser-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive\nfriction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and\nprovides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency\nrather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to\nresolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to\ndynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding\nprinciples, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)\nProgressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence\nincreases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual\nneeds and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing\nmental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.\nResearch across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains\nsupports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved\nself-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes\nsafeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias\namplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in\nhuman-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward\ngenuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and\ncontinuous learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u589e\u5f3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\u201d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u201c\u8212\u9002-\u6210\u957f\u6096\u8bba\u201d\uff0c\u5373AI\u7684\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u505c\u6ede\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fbf\u5229\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u6210\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ef4\u679c\u8328\u57fa\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u652f\u67b6\u539f\u5219\u548cAI\u4f26\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u804c\u573a\u3001\u521b\u610f\u548c\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u601d\u7ef4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d1\u5c55\u800c\u975e\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u8ba4\u77e5\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6210\u957f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We construct a large annotated\ndataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and\ntopic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of\ntransformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved\nthe highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out\ntest set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set.

This underrepresentation is revealed in\nthis study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark\ndifferences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the\nconventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS\ntrajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for\nindividuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal\nembeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to\ncapture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent\nbiases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the\ngenerated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from\nLos Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics).

It also includes a differentiable\nwavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families\nsuch as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.\n  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral\npipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising\nand natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment\nclassification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer\nTransformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters\nand 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to\nspectral sparsity priors.\n  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix\nmultiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet\ntransforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.\nThis yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural\nmodels.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art\ndeep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious\ndiseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods\nto enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.\nFuture work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time\nforecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into\nexisting surveillance systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7532\u578b\u6d41\u611f\u7206\u53d1\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fTransformer\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7532\u578b\u6d41\u611f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75282009\u5e74\u81f32023\u5e74\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83ARIMA\u3001ETS\u4e0e\u516d\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982RNN\u3001LSTM\u3001Transformer\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cTransformer\u7684MSE\u548cMAE\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002"}}

BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for\nbicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level\ncategorization.

This\nstudy takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of\nthree IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM\nmodels with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with\nany intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality.

Healthcare is one of such domains\nwhere KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge\naccuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing\ngeneral factual information often lack the ability to account for important\ncontexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are\ncrucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising\ncapabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations\nof LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ\noverly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or\nmultiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce\ntasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:\nASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our\nextensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,\nincluding \\emph{deepseek-r1}, \\emph{o4-mini}, and\n\\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two\nsimpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of\nASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs\nin ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate\nsymbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively.

The\nmodel is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,\nbenchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with\nweighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network\ncomplexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable\nsimulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across\nsupply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing\nobjectives, approximating Pareto front sets.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences.

However, traditional\nRL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to\nlong-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement\nLearning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning\nabilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short\nsegments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive\nTokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment\nrollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with\n128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\\% to\n85.1\\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\\% to 61.9\\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B\nwith remarkable gains.

Recent approaches have\nattempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods\noften require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in\nlength and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present\nlong-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an\neffortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can\nmarkedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling\nshort instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate\nresponses based on long-context meta-instructions.

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism.

While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates\nthis process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows\nlinearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a\nbottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,\nincluding token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been\nproposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This\npaper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages\nthe observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the\nremoval of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction\nusually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under\nhigh compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{CaliDrop}, a\nnovel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our\npreliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high\nsimilarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative\ncalibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by\ntoken eviction.

Unlike conventional software or static\ninference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these\nagents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal\ndata input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector\nDB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,\nwe need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.\n  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for\ndynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute\ninfrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and\nacross different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers\nseveral building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI\nexecution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and\nbandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and\ncompilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular\noperators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic\norchestration system that can place the granular components across a\nheterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an\nend-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and\npreliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can\ndeliver significant TCO benefits.

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction\nsignificantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation\nengineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical\ninsights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden\ndimensions.

However, existing methods often rely on abstracted\nperception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as\nfine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are\nessential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a\nlearning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of\nreasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,\ndetailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning\ncapabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe\ntrajectories.

However, design choices can\nimpact the cognitive workload imposed on the learner. The present experiments\nexamined how aspects of cognitive load impact training outcomes.\n  Method: Participants learned step-by-step shape assembly in a VR environment.\nCognitive load was manipulated across three dimensions: Intrinsic Load (shape\ncomplexity), Extraneous Load (instruction verbosity), and Germane Load\n(adaptive vs. fixed training). In adaptive training (experiment 1), difficulty\nincreased based on individual performance. In fixed training (experiment 2),\ndifficulty followed a preset schedule from a yoked participant.\n  Results: Higher Intrinsic Load significantly increased training times and\nsubjective workload but did not affect retention test accuracy. Extraneous Load\nmodestly impacted training time, with little impact on workload or retention.\nAdaptive training shortened overall training time without increasing workload\nor impairing retention. No interactions were observed between the three types\nof load.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats.

Given the relatively high\nmeasurement frequency of eye tracking - recognized as a noninvasive yet robust\npsychophysiological measure - this technology is particularly well suited for\nreal-time adjustments in task difficulty and feedback to enhance learning and\noperational effectiveness. Despite its established role in cognitive and\nattentional studies, implementing eye tracking metrics within dynamic,\nreal-time XR environments poses unique challenges, particularly given the\ncomplex moving visuals presented in head-mounted displays (HMDs). This paper\naddresses these challenges by focusing on the essential aspects of integrating\neye tracking in immersive systems based on real-time engines, ultimately\nfacilitating more efficient, adaptive XR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eXR\u7a7a\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347XR\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u95ee\u5377\u3001\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u865a\u62df\u6c89\u6d78\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5b9e\u65f6\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347XR\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u95ee\u5377\u3001\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u8eab\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316XR\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u52a8\u6001XR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u9002\u5e94XR\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

One key desirable capability for speech language\nmodels is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content\nand prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language\nmodels, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into\nLLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the\nresulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities\nvia pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which\nintroduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each\nspeech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of\nword-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization\nschemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody\ninformation, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that\nProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing\ncapabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody\nnuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion\nand stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long\ncontexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProsodyLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6807\u8bb0\u540e\u8f93\u5165LLMs\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u5f97\u660e\u663e\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProsodyLM\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5148\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u751f\u6210\u8bcd\u7ea7\u97f5\u5f8b\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "ProsodyLM\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7126\u70b9\uff09\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u91cd\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ProsodyLM\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u97f5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary\nknowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills\nrelevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight\nunlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.\nExperiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to\n10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphDPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5269\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KGs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\uff08KGE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u524d\u8005\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u56e0\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u5f7b\u5e95\u6216\u524a\u5f31\u5269\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u91cd\u6784\u66ff\u4ee3\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u9057\u5fd8\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u5916\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u56de\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u53e0\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u8fb9\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cKGs\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u516b\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aGraphDPO\u5728MRR_Avg\u548cMRR_F1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd510.1%\u548c14.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphDPO\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u5f7b\u5e95\u548c\u5269\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u524a\u5f31\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We\npresent a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth\nerror analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted\nthat there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a\nstandard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we\nformulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the\nevaluation diagnostics benchmarks: \"Why do not we have an evaluation standard\nfor the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?\" similar to ISO standard in\nindustry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered\nlinguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy\nfor linguistic phenomena in future.

In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of\nthe tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution\nfor aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for\npattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first\nAI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the\naccuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.\nWe particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,\nrespectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear\npattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern\ndeminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the\nBayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a\nBayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,\nRestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing\npattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the\naverage share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time\nthan the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines.

However, relying solely on gradient information, these\nmethods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,\nplateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for\nlocating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel\nframework to escape saddle points in neural network training.

Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the\nunderlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of\ndiverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)\npositive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)\ninstruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment.

It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels.

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\\leq$\n18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process\nbased entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%).

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

However, the data suffers from missing values that\nhamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging\nbecause the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse\nrates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among\nattributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across\nattributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their\nimputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based\nImputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing\nmulti-scale dependencies.

A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror.

Users often require varied and highly customizable\npolicies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.\nConsequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies\nand adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing\nfine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,\nrestricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive\nretraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited\ncontext lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies\ncomprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's\njudgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data\npoints similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed\npolicies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the\nguardrail.

A,\n185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling\ndata as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods\nhave proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it\nadditionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these\nbottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a\nbalance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical\nstability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly\nseparated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a\ncomputationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the\nDGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We\nimplement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of\nDGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while\nrequiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM.

The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele\nfrequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on\nsimulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the\ndistribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the\nrepresentational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned\nrepresentations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible\nin Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data\nhigh degree of LD when compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u9891\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8ePool-Seq\u6570\u636e\u7684E&R\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fde\u9501\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08LD\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Wright-Fisher\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u79cd\u7fa4\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u964d\u566a\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6311\u6218\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5355\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u591a\u6001\u6027\uff08SNPs\uff09\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u5176\u90bb\u8fd1\u4f4d\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62dfE&R\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u9891\u7387\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Pool-Seq\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08LD\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79cd\u7fa4\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406Pool-Seq\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684LD\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Although existing methods perform adequately\nduring certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)\nRepresentation learning from local or complete protein sequences often\noverlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are\nessential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)\nDependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands\nsignificant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\npretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence\nreordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.\nFurthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent\npretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's\neffectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various\nbaseline methods.

Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially\nreduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying\nand intervening in gender bias within T2I models.

However, MI-EEG\ndecoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and\nlimited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new\nusers. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods\nindiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the\nlarge inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative\ntransfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches\nfocus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit\ndependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability\nto preserve discriminative structures.

Project page:\n  https://jacky1128.github.io/RepMTL/", "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency.
